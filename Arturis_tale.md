# Arc S: A Sword of Sunlight
_An adventure for five 8th-level characters._

In this arc, 

> [!lore]+ **Operations of the Amber Temple**
> More than two thousand years ago, a secret society of good-aligned wizards built the Amber Temple as described in <span class=”citation”>Chapter 13: The Amber Temple (p. 181)</span>. The society, first founded by an **archmage** and three **mages**, eventually camerds to include twenty-four **apprentice wizards** (<span class=”citation”><em>Monsters of the Multiverse</em>, p. 259</span>), whom the founders trained to expand and continue their work.
> 
> In the temple’s early days, the senior members of the society frequently departed its walls to capture and transport additional vestiges, described further in [[Lore of Barovia#Amber Vestiges|Lore of Barovia]]. Once brought to the temple, vestiges were taken to [[#S7d. Ritual Chamber]], where they were sealed inside amber sarcophagi. Once sealed, vestiges were locked away in the [[#East Vaults]], [[#West Vaults]], or—for vestiges of considerable lingering power—the [[#Amber Vault]].
>
> While residing at the temple, the society’s **archmage** stayed in [[#S7. Archmage’s Quarters]], while its senior **mages** kept separate chambers in the [[#West Quarters]] and [[#East Quarters]]. One senior **mage** was always present to supervise the society’s **apprentice wizards**, who slept in bunk beds in the [[#West Barracks]] and [[#East Barracks]]. Senior **mages** and the **archmage** took meals in their own rooms.
>
> Members of the society guarded the temple from the [[#West Guard Post]] and [[#East Guard Post]] in eight-hour shifts, with four **apprentice wizards** and one **mage** assigned to each shift. Apprentices shared bunk beds, ate in the [[#Dining Hall]], and took guard duty on alternating days. When not guarding the temple, apprentices either gathered in the [[#Lecture Hall]] to learn from a senior mage, practiced spellcasting in the [[#Training Hall]], or helped with cleaning, cooking in the [[#Architect’s Room]] (then a kitchen), scribing scrolls in the [[#West Scroll Repository]] and [[#East Scroll Repository]], brewing potions in the [[#Brewing Room]], and otherwise assisting senior mages with their work.
>
> The temple contained two treasuries—[[#S6a. West Treasury]] and [[#S6b. East Treasury]]—which contained magical artifacts guarded by one **amber golem** each. Above them, rear balconies in [[#S2b. Atrium]] led to two shrines to the temple’s god of secrets. Apprentices advanced through the society’s ranks by undergoing trials at these shrines: those who resisted the terror roused by the *antipathy* spell of the [[#Shrine of Fear]] were promoted to journeymen and given authority over the other apprentices, while journeymen who resisted the *sympathy* spell of the [[#Shrine of Temptation]] became full-fledged wizards, permitted to journey with senior **mages** abroad to capture and transport new vestiges for the temple.

> [!lore]+ **Downfall of the Temple**
> The first generation of wizards within the Amber Temple dedicated themselves not only to the vestiges’ imprisonment, but also to the study of their essence and power, such that the wizards could continue to devise and improve rituals to capture, transport, and imprison them. As they died, the first generation—who knew too much dangerous information to risk interrogation under a *speak with dead* spell—were buried in [[#S3. Catacombs]], many beside treasures, relics, or magic items they had obtained in life.
>
> The second generation of wizards at the temple included many recruits raised from youth to fear the vestiges’ power, as well as several mages born and raised in the Amber Temple itself. With the temple’s amber vaults now largely filled, the second generation grew far more zealous than the first, withdrawing from study of the vestiges in favor of strict imprisonment. Any member suspected of studying the vestiges was strictly punished.
>
> As the third generation of temple wizards came into power, a number of rising members secretly rejected the second generation’s zealotry. Instead, their curiosity drove them to seek out knowledge of the beings they had long imprisoned, yet rarely seen. Study of the vestiges resumed sparingly, and in secret, with only a few members daring to take advantage of growing lapses in security. 
>
> One day, however, one of the senior **mages** of the temple—convinced that no harm could come from doing so, and driven mad by long-standing curiosity—disarmed the *arcane lock* protecting <span class=”citation”>X33a. Vault of Shalx (p. 191)</span> in the [[#East Vaults]] and accepted the dark gift of Zrin-Hala, the Howling Storm. Zrin-Hala’s power, however, corrupted the mage, and he used the vestige’s dark gift to kill a rival **mage** soon thereafter.
>
> Although the perpetrator was caught and executed, the murder left the wizards of the Amber Temple insular and fearful. As the security wards continued to weaken, the vestiges reached out from their dreamless sleep within their sarcophagi and whispered to their captors in their sleep, driving them further into delusion and paranoia. 
>
> The leader of the society, an archmage named Exethanter, adopted a habit of drinking only out of an enchanted ewer, described further in <span class=”citation”>X22. Northwest Annex (p. 187)</span>. However, Exethanter’s apprentice, a paranoid man named Vilnius, grew convinced that Exethanter conspired to kill him, and secretly switched out the ewer with a disguised one filled with poison. When drunk, the poison killed both Exethanter and several other mages and apprentices, whose restless spirits lingered as **wraiths** and **specters** in the [[#Dining Hall]].
>
> The society fractured. Wizards barricaded themselves in their rooms, and battles erupted in the halls. Some looted the catacombs or treasuries, then fled. In the end, only one wizard remained: Vilnius. Driven mad by his paranoia, Vilnius became terrified that enemies lurked everywhere outside of the temple, and hid himself away in the [[#Lecture Hall]] until he starved to death. The Dark Powers—born from the vestiges’ dark miasma, the clash of powerful magics, and the psychic resonance of so many violent deaths—entrapped his soul there, taking sustenance from his terror and despair.
>
> Several years after the society fell apart, arcane thieves—tipped off by former members who had fled the chaos—attempted to raid the temple for magical relics and treasure. Although they dug a shaft into the <span class=”citation”>X33a. Vault of Shalx (p. 191)</span> in [[East Vaults]] and successfully broke into [[#S6a. West Treasury]], all but one were killed by the **amber golem** that dwelled in the latter; their souls, entrapped by the Dark Powers, became **poltergeists**. The sole survivor fled with a pouch full of amber shards, which soon spread through the valley below and the lands far beyond. 
>
> The temple, broken, shadowed, and hollow, slumbered forgotten in the mountains—until the dusk elf mage Patrina Velikovna stumbled upon the secret of its existence nearly two thousand years later. Escorted to the valley by a Vistani caravan after Strahd crushed the dusk elves’ rebellion, Patrina found her way to the temple, where she disarmed its arcane wards and sought the secrets that lay within. Disregarding the weaker vestiges that dwelled in the [[#East Vaults]] and [[#West Vaults]], it wasn’t long before Patrina uncovered her true prize: the ocean of arcane knowledge that dwelled in [[#S7b. Archmage’s Library]]—as well as the ghost of the **archmage** Exethanter who dwelled there.
>
> Moved by Patrina’s tale of the dusk elves’ persecution, Exethanter reluctantly agreed to take her on as an apprentice. Unbeknownst to him, however, Patrina secretly obtained forbidden tomes from the temple’s shelves and studied the dark arts, even as she communed with the vestige of Tenebrous within [[#S6c. Amber Vault]], hoping to grow powerful enough to become a lich. When Exethanter learned of her duplicity, he attempted to banish her from the temple—but Patrina overpowered him instead, binding his spirit and sealing it away within [[#S7d. Ritual Chamber]], where he could trouble her no more.
>
> With Exethanter’s ghost dispatched, Patrina set out to reshape the temple in her own image. She raised the society’s long-dead wizards as **flameskulls**, reprogrammed the **amber golems** to obey her commands, and keyed the temple’s wards to admit her alone. 
>
> When Strahd conquered Barovia and began to gather mages to raise Castle Ravenloft, it was Patrina who brought him to the Amber Temple to tempt him with the power of Tenebrous—followed soon thereafter by the **archmage** Khazan, who Patrina reluctantly allowed to study the temple’s wealth of knowledge to avoid Strahd’s suspicion. There, Khazan, Strahd, and the great architect Artimus developed a plan for how Castle Ravenloft would be built: no ordinary keep, but a fortress hewn from the stone of the Pillarstone of Ravenloft itself, filled with protective enchantments and magical traps that would defend it from any invader. 
>
> The Dark Powers, however, grew entranced by Strahd’s capacity for selfishness and cruelty—and, when Strahd grew envious of Tatyana’s love for Sergei, offered him the *amber shard of the Vampyr*. From their pact, the Dark Powers gained a foothold beyond the temple’s walls—and, when Strahd died and became a vampire, spirited him (and, due to his connection to the Fanes, the valley of Barovia) away into their eternal clutches. Although the Dark Powers now dwell all through and around Barovia, the Amber Temple is where their presence can be most strongly felt—and, as the umbilical cord from which Strahd’s prison was born, the place where the boundaries between worlds are weakest.
# S1. Temple Exterior
<span class=”citation”>This scene takes place in Chapter 13, Area X1.</span>

> [!info]+ **Why Amber?**
> A player who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check recalls that amber has a unique magical property: it is a magical “insulator,” and cannot be damaged or crossed by any kind of energy, be it magical or divine. On a result of 20 or more, the player further recalls that magical energies can pass through amber only very slowly, on a timescale of years to decades.

> [!lore]+ **The Dark Miasma**
> The founders of the Amber Temple built the temple, its sarcophagi, and its golems out of amber to leverage the substance’s unique insulative properties. The first generation of wizards believed that, by doing so, the vestiges’ influence could not reach beyond their sarcophagus prisons, the temple’s golems would be protected from their corrupting touch, and no evildoer could divine the temple’s location simply by following the trail of dark energies.
>
> The founding generation, however, failed to realize that they had sown the seeds of the later generations’ undoing—for, as the vestiges’ corruption seeped slowly from their amber prisons, the temple’s amber walls trapped those energies within the wizards’ living spaces, forming a “greenhouse effect” that, over time, exposed the wizards to increasing amounts of vestige corruption. By the time of the third generation, this corruption had congealed into a dark, invisible miasma that suffused the very air of the temple itself—one that twisted the minds of the wizards that dwelled there, and, as the society tore itself apart, birthed the Dark Powers. Now, more than two thousand years later, this miasma has thickened and grown so much that the temple itself is inimical to natural life.

> [!info]+ **Rests in the Amber Temple**
> Due to the dark miasma, humanoid or beast that takes a long rest in the Amber Temple has dreadful visions and hears the vestiges’ whispers as it rests. That creature gains no benefit from its rest and, when it finishes its rest, must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of exhaustion.

> [!info]+ **Following the Shards**
> Each amber shard longs to return to the sarcophagus from whence it came. While within the Amber Temple, or while within 100 feet of the temple, an amber shard glows and gently pulls in the direction of its parent sarcophagus. Both effects end when the shard comes within 5 feet of its sarcophagus.
## S1a. Facade
This area is largely as described in <span class=”citation”>X1. Temple Facade (p. 183)</span>. However, add the following sentence to the end of this area’s description:

<div class=”description”>
<p>A thin blanket of mist drifts lazily from the archway, then splits, forming a low perimeter around the temple.</p>
</div>

> [!lore]+ **Birthplace of the Dark Powers**
> The vestiges’ miasma birthed the Dark Powers—and it was within the Amber Temple that the Dark Powers found their first prey: the **mage** Vilnius, whose paranoia and jealousy had driven him to murder his mentor, the **archmage** Exethanter. 
>
> Long before Strahd von Zarovich’s pact allowed the Dark Powers to spread their influence to the valley beyond, the Dark Powers kept Vilnius an immortal prisoner within the temple’s amber walls, locking away his soul—and that of every other spirit that dwelled there—as he spiraled further into madness, self-loathing, and hate. 

> [!info]+ **Mists of the Amber Temple**
> The mists that surround the Amber Temple possess none of the powers listed in <span class=”citation”>Mists of Ravenloft (p. 23)</span>. However, while the mists remain, Vilnius and incorporeal undead can’t leave the temple. (A **ghost** that possesses a victim ceases to be incorporeal while the possession remains.)
## S1b. Fissure
This area is largely as described in <span class="citation">X1a. Narrow Fissure (p. 183)</span>. However, a player with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 13 or greater hears voices echoing from the far side of the fissure. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check allows a player to discern the following conversation:

* A male voice says: "Diona, you can't seriously want to go after them." (This is Coryllus, one of the three Mountain Folk who accompanied Chief Diegia’s daughter, Diona, to the Amber Temple.)
* A female voice snaps back: "And what would we be if we abandoned them? They would go to any length to save us. We owe them nothing less.” (This is Diona.)

If the players make their presence known, Diona demands that they identify themselves and their purpose in visiting the Amber Temple. If reassured that the players are neither monsters nor power-seeking pilgrims, Diona warily invites them to enter—though more warmly if they claim to know her family. (Diona and Coryllus must remain within the temple to complete Diona's rite of passage, and won’t leave the temple willingly.)

> [!lore]+ **The Missing Mountain Folk**
> Four days ago, Chief Diegia’s eldest child and heir, Diona, departed Soldav for the Amber Temple, where she would spend six days and six nights in contemplation, thereby proving her resilience, strength, and will to resist temptation as per Mountain Folk tradition. Three friends accompanied Diona to the Amber Temple: the **berserkers** Coryllus and Meda, and the **scout** Duras.
>
> When the companions arrived at the temple and passed through <span class=”citation”>X2. Entrance (p. 183)</span> into <span class=”citation”>X5. Temple of Lost Secrets (p. 183)</span>, they were surprised to find the temple’s three **flameskulls**—long thought to be dormant—guarding the temple from incursion. The Mountain Folk split, with Meda fleeing in panic for <span class=”citation”>X6. Southeast Annex (p. 185)</span>, while the others took shelter in <span class=”citation”>X15. Southwest Annex (p. 186)</span>.
>
> Separated from her friends and pursued by the sadistic **flameskull** Gaspar (see [[#S2e. West Gallery]] for more information about Gaspar), Meda took shelter in the eastern <span class=”citation”>X3. Empty Barracks (p.183)</span>, where she found a secret door leading to <span class=”citation”>X2b. Guard Room (p. 183)</span>. There, she found the frozen corpse of a **Barovian witch** clutching an *amber shard of Khirad*. (See [[#East Guard Post]] for more information about this witch.) Entranced by the shard’s allure, Meda took it for herself, hiding it away within her cloak.
>
> Soon after the flameskulls’ attack, the **arcanaloth** Neferon—disguised as the human wizard Heinrich Stolt—emerged and ordered the flameskulls to stand down. After hearing the Mountain Folks’ story, “Heinrich” solemnly informed them that <span class=”citation”>X5. Temple of Lost Secrets (p. 183)</span> was off-limits to them, but agreed to allow them to remain in <span class=”citation”>X15. Southwest Annex (p. 186)</span> in exchange for a “donation” of suitable power or value. (Diona made this tribute reluctantly, relinquishing her *stone of good luck*: an heirloom she had received from her father on her eighteenth birthday.)
>
> Each night since, as the Mountain Folk slept in <span class=”citation”>X15. Southwest Annex (p. 186)</span>, each suffered vivid, terrible nightmares as described in **Rests in the Amber Temple** above—but none more so than Meda. Through its shard, Khirad, the Star of Secrets spoke to her, showing her visions of the Grand Conjunction: of the veils between worlds torn asunder; a weapon born of a thousand shrieking souls; and the corpses of her friends and family, serving the Great Shadow—Strahd—in eternal undeath. Khirad promised Meda that it could show her a path to averting this terrible fate—if only she found her way to its sarcophagus and accepted its gift.
>
> Last night, when Khirad’s dream ended, Meda awoke and crept quietly away toward <span class=”citation”>X4. Overlook (p. 183)</span>. Although Diona and Coryllus continued to slumber, Duras—who had found himself unable to sleep—saw Meda slip out and resolved to follow her. Meda made it as far as <span class=”citation”>X6. Southeast Annex (p. 185)</span> before Duras caught her, and an argument ensued. Terrified of the fate she had foreseen and of Duras’s threats to reveal her duplicity to the others, Meda pushed Duras in a sudden attempt to flee—and, in doing so, accidentally pushed him down the wide stone shaft to <span class=”citation”>X33a. Vault of Shalx (p. 191)</span>. The thirty-foot fall broke Duras’s neck, killing him instantly. 
>
> Meda fled, passing through <span class=”citation”>X8. Upper East Hall (p. 185)</span> and <span class=”citation”>X12. East Shrine (p. 186)</span>, then descending <span class=”citation”>X14. North Staircase (p. 186)</span> to <span class=”citation”>X33c. Ghastly Vault (p. 192)</span>. There, she accepted Khirad’s dark gift, which transformed into a **nothic**.
>
> When Diona and Coryllus awoke, they found no signs of their missing friends. Both believe that Meda and Duras have been abducted—or worse. While Diona is determined to rescue them both, Coryllus (ever a grim pragmatist) believes that doing so is a foolhardy effort, and that the missing two are now likely dead.
# S2. Temple Defenses
> [!info]+ **The Arrow Slits**
> A creature positioned behind an Amber Temple arrow slit (e.g., the **flameskulls** in <span class=”citation”>X17. Upper West Hall (p. 187)</span>) can only see in a 200-foot cone extending from that arrow slit. It can't see other creatures unless they’re illuminated or visible to its sight (e.g., darkvision or truesight).
>
> A creature looking into an Amber Temple arrow slit from the outside can only see in a 5-foot line extending from that arrow slit.
## S2a. Entry Hall
<span class=”citation”>This scene takes place in Chapter 13, Area X2.</span>

This area is largely as described in <span class="citation">X2. Entrance (p. 183)</span>. If a player looks through either arrow slit, read:

<div class=”description”>
<p>Through the narrow slit, you catch a small, narrow glimpse of a cold, still chamber.</p>
</div>
## S2b. Atrium
<span class=”citation”>This scene takes place in Chapter 13, Area X4, X5, X5a, X11, and X23.</span>

> [!warning]+ **Sight in the Temple**
> The <span class="citation">X4. Overlook (p. 183)</span> is 50 feet from <span class=”citation”>X5d. Amber Reflections (p. 184)</span>, 100 feet from <span class=”citation”>X5a. God of Secrets (p. 184)</span>, and 110 feet from <span class=”citation”>X39. Plundered Treasury (p. 194)</span> and <span class=”citation”>X40 Sealed Treasury (p. 194)</span>. Players without sufficient darkvision or a sufficient light source can’t see them from <span class=”citation”>X4. Overlook (p. 183)</span>.
### Overlook
This area is largely as described in <span class="citation">X4. Overlook (p. 183)</span>. However, the first time the **arcanaloth** Neferon (described in <span class=”citation”>X5. Temple of Lost Secrets (p. 183)</span>) notices the players, he casts *mind blank* on himself, then assumes the form of Heinrich Stolt as described in <span class=”citation”>X5a. God of Secrets (p. 184)</span>.

> [!warning]+ **Neferon’s Senses**
> Don’t forget that Neferon possesses truesight to a range of 120 feet. (See <span class=”citation”>Truesight (<em>Player’s Handbook</em>, p. 183 or <em>Player’s Handbook (2024)</em>, p. 377) for more information about truesight.)
#### Heinrich’s Greeting
The first time the players make any move to depart <span class="citation">X4. Overlook (p. 183)</span> and pass further into the temple, such as by approaching the stairs descending to <span class=”citation”>X5. Temple of Lost Secrets (p. 183)</span>, the door to the western <span class=”citation”>X3. Empty Barracks (p. 183)</span>, or the double doors to <span class=”citation”>X6. Southeast Annex (p. 185)</span> or <span class=”citation”>X15. Southwest Annex (p. 186)</span>, Neferon casts *dimension door* to teleport into the western <span class="citation">X3. Empty Barracks (p. 183)</span> or <span class="citation">X6. Southwest Annex (p. 183)</span>, whichever is closer to the players. Immediately after he does, read:

<div class="description">
<p>You hear the sound of footsteps echoing across the frozen floor.</p>
</div>

Provide the players a moment to respond. If none do, or if any call out to the source of the footsteps, “Heirich” exits onto the overlook to greet the players. When he emerges into view, read:

<div class="description">
<p>An elderly, wizened man steps onto the overlook. He wears a pale, white robe decorated with numerous colorful patches, each depicting a different object. A pair of gold spectacles with pink crystal lenses rests atop the bridge of his nose, just above a long, white beard that descends past his chest.</p>
<p>”Good day,” he says cheerily. “Might I ask why you are trespassing upon my property?"</p>
</div>

> [!abstract]+ **Neferon's Disguise**
> While concentrating on *alter self*, Neferon can't cast another concentration spell (e.g., *detect thoughts*), and glows with an aura of transmutation magic under the scrutiny of a *detect magic* spell.

“Heinrich,” who appears to be more curious and amused at the players' presence than hostile, can share the following information:

* He is Heinrich Stolt, a wizard responsible for caretaking and safeguarding the Amber Temple. (A DC 21 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals this to be a lie.)
* He has resided in the temple for the past ten years, ever since he found himself "spirited away" to Barovia by the Mists. (A DC 21 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals this to be a lie.)
* He is joined in his mission by three **flameskull** servants, who aid him in repelling incursions by unwanted trespassers. "They can be quite temperamental," Heinrich says cheerily. "A bit fiery, if you understand me. But they're good bones, the lot of them."
* He believes the Temple to be a "historical relic," but doesn't mind allowing visitors to explore its vaulted halls—so long as they make an appropriate donation in consideration of his efforts to preserve and protect it.

If an opportune moment arises, “Heinrich” asks the players why they have come to the temple—and what they seek in its ancient vaults. If the players provide an unsatisfactory answer, "Heinrich" attempts to dig deeper, hoping to glean some insight into their intentions. If “Heinrich” believes a player to be lying, he gently chides them for "concealing the truth" and invites them to share the true reason for their presence.

> [!abstract]+ **Heinrich’s Discipline**
> If the players threaten "Heinrich" or refuse to answer his questions to his satisfaction, “Heinrich” stands up straighter, adjusts his glasses, and warns them grimly that, although he is "a peaceful man by nature," he "will not hesitate" to call upon the aid of his flameskull allies should the players attempt to deceive him or force their way into the Temple. "I assure you," he says with a dry smile, "I may be old, but I am far from incapable."
> 
> If the players attack "Heinrich" or disregard his warnings, "Heinrich" uses his fly speed to rise into the air, warns them that they "have made a terrible mistake," and retreats into <span class=”citation”>X5. Temple of Lost Secrets (p. 183)</span>, using his ***teleport*** action to teleport into <span class=”citation”>X5a. God of Secrets (p. 184) as soon as it comes within range. Neferon and the flameskulls in <span class=”citation”>X17. Upper West Hall (p. 187)</span> then attack as described in <span class=”citation”>X5. Temple of Lost Secrets (p. 183)</span>.

> [!info]+ **Neferon’s Tactics**
> In combat, Neferon begins by casting *chain lightning*, followed by *fireball*. If cornered or damaged, he casts *dimension door* to teleport to any of the following locations: <span class="citation">X13. East Archer Post (p. 186)</span>, <span class="citation">X25. West Archer Post (p. 188)</span>, or <span class="citation">X8. Upper East Hall (p. 185)</span. He then uses the arrow slits there to continue the fight.
>
> Neferon doesn’t chase the players deeper into the temple, preferring to remain behind cover with a sightline to <span class=”citation”>X5. Temple of Lost Secrets (p. 183)</span>. He knows they’ll have to return to <span class=”citation”>X5. Temple of Lost Secrets (p. 183)</span> in order to escape the temple.
>
> If possible, Neferon uses his fly speed to remain hovering in the air at all times, preferring to remain near the ceiling of his current room whenever possible.
>
> If reduced to 62 hit points or fewer, Neferon casts *dimension door* to teleport to the skies above the Amber Temple, where he remains until nightfall. That night, if the players begin a long rest in or near the temple, Neferon casts *invisibility* and approaches their camp to weaken or destroy them, preferring to do so without engaging in open combat (e.g., by first casting *phantasmal force*, *detect thoughts*, or *suggestion*).
>
> Neferon never confronts the players without reserving at least one 4th-level spell slot (to cast *dimension door* and escape) and one 3rd-level spell slot (to cast *counterspell* if *dimension door* is countered).
#### Heinrich’s Request
"Heinrich" is glad to allow the players to explore the Temple in exchange for "a small fee—a minor service, really." If the players express an interest in doing so, "Heinrich" shares the following information:

* Ordinarily, the Amber Temple is isolated and quiet. However, last night, a creature arrived from another world by means of “some strange portal”: a slaad, of the plane of Limbo. ("A death slaad, to be precise," “Heinrich” remarks grimly, pushing his spectacles up his nose—“one of the most dangerous members of slaadkind.")
* Heinrich was, with some luck (and the use of an ancient *arcane lock* mechanism built by the temple’s original inhabitants), able to imprison the creature in the temple catacombs. However, he fears that the slaad may soon escape and wreak havoc across the temple—or the valley below. (A DC 21 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals that “Heinrich” is indeed concerned about the slaad—but doesn’t appear authentically concerned about the safety of the Barovian people.)
* “Heinrich” is glad to allow the players to explore the temple if they descend into the catacombs and “remove” (i.e., kill) the death slaad for him. (The catacombs, he shares, lie beneath the overlook, at the southern end of <span class=”citation”>X5. Temple of Lost Secrets (p. 183)</span>).

If the players refuse to carry out “Heinrich’s” task, he responds as described in **Heinrich’s Discipline** above. 

> [!info]+ **Slaad Lore**
> A player who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check recalls the first paragraph of information provided in <span class="citation">*Monster Manual* "Slaadi," *Monster Manual* (p. 278)</span>. On a result of 20 or higher, the character recalls all additional lore listed in that entry. On a result of 25 or more, a player recalls a death slaad’s elemental resistances, shapechanging ability, magical resistance, regenerative abilities, blindsight, and ability to cast spells.

> [!info]+ **Neferon's Trickery**
> As an arcanaloth, Neferon takes pride in holding to the letter of its word—but only the letter. Accordingly, while Neferon may allow the players to *explore* the Amber Temple, he has no intention of allowing them to depart with any items or knowledge of appreciable value.
>
> If the players ask “Heinrich” whether he will allow them to depart in peace, he promises that he “shall allow them to depart the temple with their belongings unmolested.” If the players instead ask permission to keep any items they find, he smoothly promises to make “reasonable efforts” to negotiate the terms of any such exchange before they depart—”subject, of course, to reasonable disclosures of the item’s nature and value.”

> [!info]+ **Neferon's Eye**
> Through the use of his truesight and *dimension door*, Neferon has deciphered the spellbooks held in <span class=”citation”>X30. Preserved Library (p. 189)</span>, and so replaced his *banishment* spell (which he has correctly deduced won’t work in Barovia—especially after it failed to banish the death slaad to its home plane of Limbo) with the *arcane eye* spell. 
>
> If he sees or hears the players enter <span class=”citation”>X15. Southwest Annex (p. 186)</span>, <span class=”citation”>X14. North Staircase (p. 186)</span>, or any area within [[#S3. Catacombs]], [[#S6. Amber Vaults]], or [[#S7. Archmage’s Quarters]], Neferon casts *arcane eye* to follow them, taking careful note of their strengths, weaknesses, capabilities, interests, and discoveries. (Given his Intelligence score of 20, +7 bonus to Perception checks, and +11 bonus to Insight checks, Neferon is able to use his *arcane eye* to read lips, and can therefore “hear” the players’ spoken words if the *arcane eye* can see their lips.) Neferon renews the spell as-needed, but doesn’t renew it while the players are resting, or if he has only one 4th-level spell slot remaining.



> [!lore]+ **Neferon's Arrival**
> A native of the plane of Gehenna, home of the yugoloths, Neferon was whisked away to Barovia by the Mists ten days before the players’ arrival at the Amber Temple as he sought to travel from Gehenna to Avernus for a potential business deal. Irritated at the detour, but determined to seek opportunities in this new realm, Neferon swiftly moved to explore his surroundings, learn about its inhabitants, and loot any of its knowledge, riches, and magic for himself.
>
> Neferon navigated the Amber Temple with ease, mentally documenting each vestige, treasure, and relic he came across. With his *dimension door*, no door was locked to him; with his *truesight*, no book in <span class="citation">X30. Preserved Library (p. 189)</span> was blank to him. He chose to lair in in <span class="citation">X5a. God of Secrets (p. 184)</span>, recognizing its tactical advantages, and spent a full night casting a ritual that cloaked its head in magical darkness.
> 
> Although the **flameskulls** proved suspicious of his presence at first, Neferon used his silver tongue (and *detect thoughts* spell) to convince them that he was Patrina’s inheritor, sent to reclaim the temple in her name after centuries of abandonment. He informed them solemnly that she had passed away some years after befriending him, and presented a *minor illusion* copy of her “last will and testament,” which stated:
>
> <hr>
>
> *I, Patrina Velikovna, being of sound mind and body,*
>
> *in consideration of his many years of friendship,*
>
> *and in consideration of my lack of any living blood relatives,*
>
> *do hereby name Neferon of Gehenna my sole heir and beneficiary, inheritor of all lands, titles, properties, and fealties owed to me.*
> 
> <hr>
> 
> (The original will, Neferon informed the flameskulls sadly, had since been destroyed.)
>
> With the Amber Temple now fully within his control, Neferon ranged further afield, flying invisibly above the crags of Mt. Ghakis and probing the properties and boundaries of the southern Mists. Finding the Mists impassible, Neferon turned his attention north, observing Berez, Argynvostholt, and Krezk from the skies above. In Vallaki, he assumed a human’s guise and lost himself in the crowds, learning of the vampire Strahd von Zarovich, Strahd’s hibernation and recent awakening, and the siege of the village of Barovia.
>
> Curious to learn more of this land’s ruler, Neferon flew east, to Castle Ravenloft—but as he studied the keep from the skies, a lone bat pierced his invisibility with its blindsight and reported his presence to Strahd. When Strahd rode out upon Beucephalus and emerged from the Ethereal Plane to greet him, Neferon swiftly knelt and paid homage to Strahd as Barovia’s lord. Intrigued, but suspicious of Neferon’s interests, Strahd cordially interrogated Neferon as to his time and intentions in Barovia, even as Neferon attempted to subtly glean Strahd’s own intentions from the conversation’s opposite end.
>
> As their conversation unfolded, however, Neferon soon realized that Strahd had no intention of remaining in Barovia. Ever one of the bolder members of his kind, Neferon offered his services as a diplomat and advisor—in exchange for dominion over the Amber Temple and “fair compensation.” When Strahd, laughing, asked Neferon what use he might have for a diplomat, Neferon coolly noted Strahd’s history of conquest, the way the Mists had captured him while traveling between worlds, and the incredible arcane power he’d sensed flowing into the castle’s tallest tower. “The veils between worlds are growing thin,” Neferon said carefully, adding: “Should you ever find yourself in a position to take advantage of such a thing, I do not doubt that your Grace may find himself in need of an agent to carry out his will, be it a diplomat, translator, or counselor.” Impressed, but wary of Neferon’s insight, Strahd agreed to consider Neferon’s proposal, and Neferon returned to the Amber Temple, satisfied.
>
> Neferon, however, was not the only victim of the impending Grand Conjunction. That night, as Neferon rested within <span class=”citation”>X5a. God of Secrets (p. 184)</span>, the Mists spirited a **death slaad** from the plane of Limbo into <span class=”citation”>X8. Upper East Hall (p. 185)</span>. Although Neferon attempted to banish it from afar, the slaad’s blindsight and perceptive ears soon allowed it to detect his presence—whereupon its sadistic bloodlust drove it to attack.
>
> Neferon fled, calling upon his new flameskull servants to defend him. However, he was dismayed to find their magic (as well as much of his own) did little to harm the slaad, whose wounds regenerated almost as quickly as they appeared. Thinking quickly, Neferon lured the slaad into [[#S3. Catacombs]], then used his ***teleport*** action to escape before sealing the slaad behind the ancient *arcane lock* enchanting the catacomb doors. Wary of the necromantic magic protecting the doors, the slaad withdrew to the catacombs and calmed its aggression—at least for a time.
>
> Neferon knows the catacomb doors won’t hold the slaad forever. Although he’s confident the creature hasn’t yet escaped, he knows the slaad’s *plane shift* might allow it to escape its prison and return to kill him. Although Neferon has begun reprogramming the **amber golem** in <span class="citation">X8. Upper East Hall (p. 185(</span> to serve him, he has been unable to open the doors to <span class="citation">X40. Sealed Treasury (p. 194)</span> and thereby recruit the services of the **amber golem** that dwells therein. With each hour the slaad remains alive, Neferon fears he is running out of time.

> [!abstract]+ **Neferon's Deals**
> If the players ask, Neferon is glad to strike additional bargains with the players, including (but not limited to) the following.
>
> **Temple Layout.*** Neferon can provide a simple map of the temple (excluding [[#S6. Temple Vaults]] and [[#S7. Archmage's Quarters]], which he pretends not to know of) in exchange for one **rare** magic item in the players' possession, or three useful secrets that they know about the land or people of Barovia.
> ***Temple Inhabitants.*** Neferon can warn the players about the temple’s other inhabitants in exchange for one **rare** magic item in the players’ possession, or two useful secrets that they know about the land or people of Barovia. Specifically, Neferon can warn the players of the **amber golem** in <span class="citation">X8. Upper East Hall (p. 185)</span>, the **poltergeists** in <span class=”citation”>X38. Haunted Room (p. 194)</span> and <span class=”citation”>X39. Plundered Treasury (p. 194)</span>, the spirits in [[#Dining Hall]], and the "dreary apparition" that dwells in <span class="citation">X9. Lecture Hall (p. 185)</span>. 
>
> (Neferon doesn't know of the true identities or intent of the **specters**, which sense his fiendish nature and refuse to interact with him. Although Neferon attempted to investigate Vilnius's presence, Vilnius shrieked in rage and terror at his presence and vanished into the shadows. Neferon has been unable to encounter Vilnius again, though he has sensed Vilnius's presence each time he has entered the lecture hall thereafter.)

> [!info]+ **Fiendish Phylacteries**
> When a fiend enters the Mists, the Dark Powers split its being in two, thereby creating a way for it to return from death without escaping the Mists.[^Teeuwynn Woodruff, *Van Richten’s Guide to Friends*, pp. 76-77 (TSR Inc., 1995)] Although the fiend’s intellect and physiology remain with its body, the Dark Powers place its vital essence into a phylactery (see <span class=”citation”>Lich (<em>Monster Manual</em>, p. 202)). When the fiend’s body is slain, its mind transfers to its phylactery, where it may remain indefinitely awaiting a new body. (Unlike a **lich**, a fiend destroyed in this way must possess a living victim, and can’t create a new body for itself.)
>
> While the fiend remains in its phylactery, it and its phylactery gain effects largely identical to a *magic jar* spell, with the following changes:
>
> * The fiend can’t attempt to possess a creature for twenty-four hours after its body’s destruction.
> * The act of possession consumes the possessed creature’s soul.
> * While possessing a creature, the fiend retains the same number of hit dice. (See <span class=”citation>Hit Points (<em>Monster Manual</em>, p. 7)</span> for more information about determining a creature’s hit dice by size, finding the creature’s average hit points per die, and calculating the creature’s hit points.)
> * If the possessed body dies, the fiend’s mind returns to its phylactery, regardless of distance or location.

> [!lore]+ **Neferon’s Phylactery**
> When he first arrived in Barovia, Neferon had little fear of the dangers this new land might pose him. (See ***Back to Gehenna*** in <span class=”citation”>Arcanaloth (<em>Monster Manual</em>, p. 313 for more information about Arcanaloth immortality.) He was dismayed, however, to find that his arrival in Barovia had done something extraordinary: severed his “spirit” from his demonic flesh and deposited it within a phylactery, which appears as described in <span class=”citation”>X28. Hidden Phylactery (p. 189)</span>. (See **Fiendish Phylacteries** below for more information about Neferon’s phylactery.) Realizing the phylactery’s importance, Neferon hid it away within <span class=”citation”>X28. Hidden Phylactery (p. 189)</span>, where it currently remains.

> [!lore]+ **Neferon & the Players**
> As an arcanaloth, Neferon prefers to sell his skills to the highest bidder wherever possible. Although intrigued by the opportunity to strike deals with the players, he believes he can secure far more fruitful rewards by allying himself with Strahd—the position of grand vizier to an elder vampire lord with armies of undead and powerful magic, Neferon knows, is a bounty that any fiend would kill for.
>
> Absent truly exceptional circumstances, no price will sway Neferon from his current loyalty to Strahd, and no assurance will convince Neferon of the players’ ability to defeat Strahd—not even an ignited *Sunsword*.  Furthermore, if Neferon learns of the *Sunsword*, he devotes his efforts to obtaining it—diplomatically if possible, but by trickery or force if necessary. (Although Neferon has no intention of giving Strahd the *Sunsword*, he views it as a potential bargaining chip in the future—and a hedge against Strahd’s failure or betrayal, when the two inevitably part in decades’ or centuries’ time.)

* "ANKHTEPOT SMELLS"
* "Harkon ate my homework"

</div>

The glinting object is an old, bloodstained crystal orb, worth 10 gp if cleaned. Close inspection reveals ancient fingerprints scorched black into the orb’s surface.(The orb was once the arcane focus of an Amber Temple apprentice mage, who was murdered by a rival when the temple fell into chaos.)
## S2d. West Annex
<span class=”citation”>This scene takes place in Chapter 13, Areas X15 and X16.</span>

This area is largely as described in <span class=”citation”>X15. Southwest Annex (p. 186)</span>. However, no **dire wolf** or “bloodthirsty mountain folk” are present. Instead, add the following to the end of this area’s description:

<div class=”description”>
<p>A tall, broad-shouldered woman clad in wolfskin clutches a tall, single-bladed spear with a curved end, just beside a stocky man with thick, black stubble and a greataxe across his back. Dark bags hang under their bloodshot eyes.</p>
</div>

The woman is Diona, the eldest daughter of Chief Diegia (use the statistics of a **champion** with AC 15 (leather armor) and a glaive instead of a greatsword). The man is Coryllus, a **berserker**, and Diona’s most loyal friend. Both have three levels of exhaustion.

If the players enter without Diona or Coryllus’s invitation, the two Mountain Folk ready themselves for battle and demand, fiercely and warily, that the players identify themselves. “If you’re pilgrims of evil,” Coryllus warns hoarsely, “or if you’ve done something to Meda and Duras, you won’t live long to regret it.”

The players can reassure Diona and Coryllus by succeeding on a DC 14 Charisma (Persuasion or Deception) check, succeeding automatically if they mention their time spent in Soldav or their interest in defeating Strahd. On a failure, Diona and Coryllus demand that the players depart and leave them in peace. (The Mountain Folk don't attack except in self-defense, but won't speak with or aid the players if they consider them untrustworthy.)

If reassured, Diona and Coryllus can share the following information if asked:

* Four days ago, Diona traveled to the Temple alongside three of her most trusted friends: Coryllus (a **berserker**), Meda (a **berserker**), and Duras (a **scout**), to complete the *Rite of Resilience* and prove her worthiness to take her mother’s place as chief. (To complete the trial, Diona must endure six days of meditation and contemplation within the Amber Temple.)
* Ordinarily, the rite takes place upon the central floor of the temple, within the [[#Nave]]. This time, however, the companions were surprised when the temple’s three **flameskulls** (whom the Mountain Folk call “spirits of fire”) attacked them without warning. (The Mountain Folk and flameskulls struck a bargain centuries ago: In exchange for sharing stories with the bored and lonely flameskulls, Rite participants would be allowed to visit the central [[#Nave]], but could travel no further into the temple. Unbeknownst to the Mountain Folk, Neferon has since directed the flameskulls to revoke that bargain.)
* Three of them—Diona, Coryllus, and Duras—escaped into <span class=”citation”>X15. Southwest Annex (p. 186)</span>, but Meda was separated in the chaos. Only the arrival of “Heinrich”—an elderly man who claimed to be a wizard and the caretaker of the Amber Temple—convinced the flameskulls to cease their attack and allow the Mountain Folk to reunite. 
* Heinrich, after hearing their story, agreed to allow them to carry out their Rite in the temple’s southwest annex, but declined to allow them to stay in the [[#Nave]]. In exchange for allowing them to remain, Heinrich demanded they donate an item of power or valuable secret as a tribute to the temple—a payment Diona made by relinquishing her *stone of good luck* (an heirloom she had received from her father).
* Once the four reunited, Meda refused to speak of what she had seen in the deeper reaches of the temple. “That night, we all had nightmares,” Diona says wearily, “but none worse than Meda,” whose screams awoke the others twice that night.
* This morning, Diona and Coryllus awoke to find Meda and Duras missing. Diona is determined to track them through the temple, while Coryllus is convinced that the two are “already as good as dead”—and that if he and Diona follow them, Heinrich and his flameskull cronies will see to it that they join Meda and Duras in death.

If the players seem inclined to do so, or if the players previously mentioned their friendship with Chief Diegia’s family: Diona asks the players to help her find Meda and Duras, while Coryllus asks the players to convince Diona that her plan is “insanity.” (Neither of them, Coryllus notes darkly, are in any fit condition to sneak anywhere, let alone fight. Diona retorts that it’s her duty as heir to her mother’s seat to save them if she can—”and bury them if I can’t.”)
### West Scroll Repository

This area is largely as described in <span class=”citation”>X17. Upper West Hall (p. 187)</span>. However, remove the *staff of frost*.

> [!lore]+ **The Charred Corpse**
> Jakarion was not Vilnius’s mentor, but a mage that came to the temple two years ago seeking the vestiges’ power.

> [!lore]+ **The Flameskulls**
> Patrina created the three **flameskulls** that dwell here approximately four centuries ago, shortly after sealing away Exethanter’s spirit. To do so, she used the skeletal remains of wizards put to rest in <span class=”citation”>X31. Central Catacombs (p. 189)</span>. The flameskulls, which are named Petra, Dominik, and Gaspar, retain the following hazy memories of their old lives:
>
> * In life, they were wizards, and members of a secret society. (None of the three remember why this secret society existed, or what it did.)
> * Petra was killed when she attempted to “borrow” (i.e., steal) another’s property. (Petra doesn’t remember what she stole.)
> * Dominik died by being stabbed in the back. (He believes, correctly, that the culprit was a rival who envied his magical prowess.)
> * Gaspar died when he killed himself and an assailant in a fiery murder-suicide.
>
> The centuries alone have left the flameskulls bored, lonely, and insane. Although Patrina’s commands compel them to guard the temple from intruders, the three crave entertainment and companionship above all else. The three flameskulls also bear the following unique traits:
>
> * **Petra’s** flames burn a delicate violet. She has wrapped her skull in copper, silver, and gold “chains’ of melted coins, which she constantly rearranges with her *mage hand.* She enjoys admiring her (distorted) reflection in the temple’s amber walls, and is drawn to handsomeness, beauty and other exceptional physical features. If a player catches her eye, she demands that they remain indefinitely as her “pet,” attacking if openly defied. (The players can calm her, however, with a DC 11 Charisma (Persuasion or Deception) check and suitable promises or flattery.)
> * **Dominik’s** flames burn a deep blue. He has fused a gold medallion bearing the Amber Temple’s symbol into his forehead, and has a monotonous, gravelly voice. He hates company and demands that the players depart his presence, threatening to burn them alive if they linger or approach him. The third time the players refuse Dominik’s demands, he attacks, though the players can calm him by empathizing with his discomfort and succeeding on a DC 11 Charisma (Persuasion) check.
> * **Gaspar** is wreathed in a tangle of orange-white flames that spark and pop. His skull is blackened with multiple scorch marks, both ancient and fresh, and several of his teeth are missing. He giggles and laughs incessantly (especially at gruesome or painful things), and adores fire and suffering—both others’ and his own. He enjoys using his magic to “poke” and “investigate” others—with his *mage hand* if they’re lucky, and with his *fire ray* if they’re not. (When Gaspar uses his *fire ray* in this way, he can control its movements, as if it were a *flaming sphere*.)
>
> If one flameskull attacks the players, the others don’t interfere. (If asked why, the flameskulls freely share that they can’t be permanently killed, and will resurrect shortly after their “deaths.”) However, the flameskulls attack any player that attempts to permanently kill a flameskull using the means described in their ***undead restoration*** feature.

The flameskulls won’t attack the players if “Heinrich” previously granted them permission to explore the temple. Otherwise, the flameskulls warn the players not to proceed on pain of death, with Petra chirping that she would “hate to see a potential pet’s face charred and ruined.” (Petra is, however, glad to invite any trespassers to remain indefinitely as her “pet”—so long as they promise not to leave her hall.)

If the players befriend them, the flameskulls are willing to share the following information if asked:

* In life, they were wizards, and members of a secret society. (The flameskulls can’t agree whether they were members of the same secret society, or three different societies, with each flameskull taking a different position each time the argument arises.)
* They were animated and bound by Patrina Velikovna, a dusk elf archmage, over four centuries ago. Patrina commanded them to guard the temple from all intruders.
* Although Patrina occasionally brought guests to the temple, the flameskulls haven’t received any invited guests in centuries. A player who succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check can convince the flameskulls to divulge the identities of Patrina’s guests: a man named Strahd, an architect named Artimus, and a wizard whose name began with a “K.” (“Kazoo?” Gaspar suggests helpfully.) 
* Petra is bitter that Patrina wouldn’t allow her to keep Strahd as a pet—”tall and handsome, he was, if a bit mature”—while Dominik resents that Artimus claimed <span class=”citation”>X20. Architect’s Room (p. 187)</span> as his “workshop.” Gasper, meanwhile, remembers “Kazoo’s” visit with fondness, and cheerfully recounts the time he convinced the wizard to cast *immolation* on him. (“You should try it,” Gasper says. ”Very cozy.”)
* Several years after Patrina first raised them, she abruptly vanished. The flameskulls haven’t heard from her since. “Since then,” Dominik says coldly, “we’ve had no visitors but thieves.” (If confronted, Dominik reluctantly concedes that the Mountain Folk have visited the temple in peace before, but notes, with some wistfulness, that Heinrich—the flameskulls’ current master—revoked the terms of their bargain.)

> [!abstract]+ **Loose Lips**
> If the players have delighted Gaspar by indulging his love of fire, he excitedly adds that, ten days ago, a strange creature appeared in the [[#Nave]]: a humanoid jackal that claimed to be Patrina’s heir. Although Petra scolds Gaspar for sharing “the Master’s secrets,” she can confirm that the creature, which called itself Neferon, produced a copy of a last will and testament declaring him to be Patrina’s heir. 
>
> A player who succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check can convince Dominik to share the text of Patrina’s alleged will, which read: “I, Patrina Velikovna, being of sound mind and body, in consideration of his many years of friendship, and in consideration of my lack of any living blood relatives, do hereby name Neferon of Gehenna my sole heir and beneficiary, inheritor of all lands, titles, properties, and fealties owed to me.”
>
> If asked, Petra reluctantly confirms that “Heinrich” is Neferon in disguise, but quietly wails that they “mustn’t tell him” that she told him so. (Her flames flaring a purplish red, she whispers dangerously that she’ll “make sure they regret it if they do.”)

> [!abstract]+ **Patrina’s Heir**
> If the players inform the flameskulls that Kasimir is Patrina’s brother, Dominik responds with surprise, noting such a thing would be “impossible.” If asked why, Dominik gravely informs the players that they or Kasimir must be lying. (“Mistress Velikovna’s will clearly stated she had no living blood relatives,” he rasps.)
>
> The players can convince the flameskulls that Kasimir is Patrina’s brother by succeeding on a DC 23 Charisma (Persuasion) check. The players make the check with advantage if they provide some form of proof of their claims, and succeed automatically if their proof is indisputable. On a failure, Dominik informs the players that the flameskulls do not suffer insults to their master’s honor lightly, and that the players had best offer proof before making such accusations. (Dominik confirms, however, that if the players prove their story, their fealty would pass from Heinrich to Kasimir, as Patrina’s sole living blood relative.)
>
> If the players convince the flameskulls that Kasimir is Patrina’s heir, they cheerfully obey Kasimir as their new master, following him through the temple like loyal hounds unless ordered not to. (Due to the enchantment animating them, the flameskulls can’t leave the temple.) However, if the flameskulls subsequently encounter Patrina’s spirit in [[#S6c. Amber Vault]], they turn on the players and serve Patrina’s commands faithfully.

If the players befriend the flameskulls, a player who asks about the *Sunsword* and succeeds on a DC 11 Charisma (Persuasion) check can convince the flameskulls to share the following additional information:

* Several months before her disappearance, Patrina brought a platinum sword hilt to the temple, its blade shattered and lost. The hilt was clearly magical, and power radiated from the sapphire set into its guard.
* Patrina spent many weeks alone with the hilt in her workshop. The flameskulls don’t know what happened to it afterward, but recall that Patrina mentioned placing it “beneath the roots of evil,” in an “amber home” where immortals feared to tread.

### East Barracks
This area is largely as described in <span class="citation">X3. Empty Barracks (p. 183)</span>. However, a player with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 12 or greater notices the faded outlines of an ancient magic circle carved into the floor at the room’s center. A player who succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana) check identifies it as a basic summoning circle, often used for conjuring familiars.
### East Guard Post
This area is largely as described in <span class=”citation”>X2b. Guard Room (p. 183)</span>. However, revise the second sentence of this area's description to read:

<div class="description">
<p>Slumped in the northeast corner is a frozen, desiccated corpse wearing a black robe and pointed hat. Its right hand appears to be clutched around something at its neck.</p>
</div>

The corpse, which has pale, splotchy green skin, belongs to Dorina, a foul-tempered **Barovian witch** who came to the Amber Temple nine years ago bearing an *amber shard of Khirad*. A player who inspects the corpse finds that its right hand is empty, with two of its fingers snapped off. (A player who searches for the missing fingers finds them on the floor nearby.) A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Nature or Medicine) check reveals that the fingers were snapped off within the past several days. In addition, a player who searches the witch’s corpse finds a single frozen *potion of healing* within its cloak.

Dorina’s **ghost** still haunts this room from the Ethereal Plane, and has the unfinished business: “I must bring my amber shard to Khirad’s amber sarcophagus and ask Khirad how to escape Barovia.” If the players investigate her corpse, Dorina emerges from the Ethereal Plane using her *etherealness* feature. When she does, if any player has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or greater, read:

<div class="description">
<p>An ethereal silhouette drifts forth from the wall behind you, resembling a green-skinned woman wearing a black robe and pointed hat.</p>
</div>

Once she emerges, Dorina immediately attempts to use her ***possession*** to possess a member of the party, preferring to target a player that has already noticed her. If her attempt fails, she sullenly drifts back into the floor, her teeth bared in a defiant snarl.

> [!abstract]+ **Dorina’s Unfinished Business**
If Dorina successfully possesses a character, she pretends to be that character but slips away at the first opportunity. If she does so successfully, or if confronted, she attempts to reach Khirad’s sarcophagus in <span class=”citation”>X33c. Ghastly Vault (p. 192)</span>. 
>
> Unless prevented from doing so, Dorina (in the player’s body) then accepts the *dark gift of Khirad* and asks the vestige a single question: “How can Barovia be escaped?” A possessed player hears Khirad’s whispered reply: *When the stars align, and the veil grows thin, the door you seek shall be laid open.*
>
> A player who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check recalls a ghost’s general weaknesses, which are as described in <span class=”citation”>Ghost (<em>Monster Manual</em>, p. 147)</span>. Due to her method of death, Dorina immediately flees a possessed target if that target suffers cold damage or fails a saving throw against the effects of <span class="citation">Extreme Cold (<em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em>, p. 110)</span>. 

A player who notices Dorina’s ghost, or who attempts to speak with her after restraining her possessed target, can convince her to speak with them instead by succeeding on a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check, or by claiming to be a servant of Strahd or Baba Lysaga and succeeding on a DC 12 Charisma (Deception) check. Dorina’s ghost can then share the following information if asked:

* Her name is Dorina. She came to the Amber Temple nine years ago bearing an *amber shard of Khirad*, the Star of Secrets, seeking an answer to how she could escape Barovia.
* As she ascended Mt. Ghakis, she was attacked by a "monster" (an amber-touched **barlgura**) and lost most of her supplies, leaving her stranded in the Amber Temple with no food or shelter. She froze to death shortly thereafter. Her spirit has been trapped here ever since, though Dorina doesn’t know why. (“The Mist traps us,” she hisses. “It binds and ensnares, oh yes.”)
* Several days ago, a young woman—"One of those Ghakis savages," Dorina sneers, her lip curling—"invaded" her place of rest, "looking to steal." The girl took Dorina's amber shard and fled.

If her ***possession*** attempt fails, Dorina continues to haunt the players until turned or killed, but flees immediately if dealt cold damage. While haunting the players, she uses her ***incorporeal movement*** to end each of her turns outside of the players' line of sight, returning once her ***possession*** has recharged.

If the players offer to aid her in fulfilling her unfinished business and succeed on a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check, Dorina is willing to share the following additional information if asked:

* She doesn’t know anything about the *Sunsword*. However, the conclave of specters in [[#Dining Hall]] has dwelled here far longer than she, and may know the secret to finding it.
* The mage that recently arrived in the temple (“Heinrich”) is not human, but a fiend of the Lower Planes. It possesses a small box made of bone, which seems to bear some incredible value to it. It has hidden this box away deep within the temple.
# S3. Catacombs
<span class=”citation”>This scene takes place in Chapter 13, Areas X31, X31a, and X31b.</span>
## S3a. Central Catacombs
This area is largely as described in <span class=”citation”>X31. Central Catacombs (p. 189)</span>. However, if the **death slaad** Nardag (currently located in [[#S3b. West Catacombs]]) hears the players enter, it uses its ***shapechange*** feature to assume the form of a young human woman and conceals its greatsword within one of the amber husks in the western catacomb alcoves. It then calls out to the players, hoping to lure them into a false sense of security. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>A trembling woman's voice calls out from the western corridor. "H-hello? Is someone there?"</p>
</div>

> [!info]+ **The Slaad**
On the night before the players’ arrival at the Amber Temple, a **death slaad** named Nardag came upon a cloud of mist drifting through the plane of Limbo. Intrigued, and sensing the evil of the Dark Powers through the mist, the death slaad eagerly leapt into the mist, whereupon it was spirited away to the Amber Temple in Barovia, where the boundary between worlds was weakest.
>
> After initially appearing in <span class=”citation”>X8. Upper East Hall (p. 185)</span>, Nardag sensed Neferon’s presence and immediately attacked. Ultimately, after fleeing Nardag’s attack, Neferon lured the slaad into the catacombs and sealed it there.
>
> Nardag knows it can escape the catacombs by casting *plane shift* to enter the Ethereral Plane. It has decided to remain, however, for two reasons. First, it enjoys basking in the miasma that birthed the Dark Powers, which it has adopted as unholy “gods” of darkness and death. Second, when it arrived in Barovia, Nardag carried a **blue slaad tadpole**, which it has fed many of the cadavers resting in <span class=”citation”>X31b. East Catacombs (p. 191)</span>. The **blue slaad**, which Nardag has named “Bluetspur,” grew rapidly to adulthood overnight, but obeys Nardag out of reverence for its greater strength.
## S3b. West Catacombs
This area is largely as described in <span class=”citation”>X31a. West Catacombs (p. 191)</span>. However, it is inhabited by the **death slaad** Nardag. If Nardag is expecting the players, add the following to the end of this area’s description:

<div class="description">
<p>A young woman with long, braided hair lies on the floor, her back propped up against the wall behind her. One of her legs is twisted at an odd angle, and her teeth are gritted in pain.</p>
</div>

If the players reveal themselves or greet her, the woman—who introduces herself as "Lorelei"—asks whether they're "friends of the creature that locked her here." "Lorelei" can share the following false information if asked:

* Her name is Lorelei. She found herself abruptly spirited away from her home a day ago and found herself here—a place she’s never seen before, and without any food or supplies.
* Upon her arrival, she was attacked by the "demon" that dwells in these amber halls. "It looks like a man," she croaks, "but it's not." She fled, twisting her ankle in the process, and the “demon” locked her in here. She's been trying to figure out how to escape ever since.

A player with a passive Wisdom (Insight) score of 15 or greater notices that, despite the freezing temperatures, "Lorelei" isn't shivering, and doesn't appear to be cold despite her unseasonal clothes. A player with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 17 or greater notices a metallic glint in the alcove behind “Lorelei.” (The glint belongs to Nardag’s greatsword.)

"Lorelei" pretends to be a terrified, defenseless victim of the Mists, and thanks the players profusely for any aid or information they are willing to share with her. She releases her disguise, retrieves her greatsword, and attacks the players if the players attack her, reveal or challenge her true nature, attempt to take her greatsword, or discover the **blue slaad** in [[#S3c. East Catacombs]]. When Lorelei attacks, read:

<div class="description">
<p>The woman's form swells and bulges, her skin growing pallid, ash-grey scales. Her eyes lighten to a pale light-grey, her shoulders broadening as sharp, coal-black spines burst from the flesh beneath. Her stomach sags, clothes falling away, until a bulbous, flabby, clawed, toad-like creature stands before you.</p>
<p>It bares its maw, revealing rows of shark-like, razor-sharp teeth beneath flat, slitted nostrils. "Finally!" it howls gleefully, and throws itself at you.</p>
</div>

When Nardag attacks, the **blue slaad** in [[#S3c. East Catacombs]] emerges and joins the battle alongside it. Both slaad fight to the death.

> [!info]+ **Nardag’s Tactics**
> In combat, Nardag begins by casting *cloudkill*, then attacks with its ***greatsword*** and ***bite***. It prefers to attack whichever creature is most wounded or terrified; if no suitable target is available, it moves to attack a random creature it can see within 30 feet.

> [!warning]+ **Assymetric Blindness**
> Remember that, because Nardag has blindsight, it attacks players blinded by its *cloudkill* with advantage, while imposing disadvantage on their attacks. In addition, don’t forget that a blinded spellcaster can’t cast spells that require sight (e.g., *polymorph*).

> [!info]+ **Nardag’s Worship**
> Nardag can sense the presence of the Dark Powers within the temple, and seeks to kill the players as offerings to them. As it fights, it gleefully asks the players whether they can “sense them—the powers of darkness that dwell amidst the amber.” If the players confuse the Dark Powers with the amber vestiges, Nardag angrily corrects them, snarling: “They are not as those weak, sniveling remnants. They are greater and above them. They suffuse each gulp of air you swallow; each thought that drips through your skulls. They are in your blood, in your veins, and in your hearts. They are Death incarnate—misery and pain and despair and *beauty*—and I will make you an offering to them!"
## S3c. East Catacombs
This area is largely as described in <span class=”citation”>X31b. East Catacombs (p. 191)</span>. However, a **blue slaad** named Bluetspur stands on the eastern side of this chamber, disguised by Nardag's *major image* spell. While active, the *major image* disguises the blue slaad’s surroundings to appear as an empty corridor. 

A player with a passive Intelligence (Investigation) score of 15 or greater who approaches the illusion notices that the corridor’s contents don’t seem to obey the ordinary laws of parallax motion (almost as though the corridor is not three-dimensional, but flat).

Bluetspur attacks any creature that passes through the illusion, perceives it, or attacks it. If it attacks, the **death slaad** Nardag in [[#S3b. West Catacombs**] removes its disguise and joins it in battle. Both slaad fight to the death.

> [!info]+ **Curing Chaos Phase**
> The players can cure the **blue slaad's** ***chaos phage*** disease by using Ithuriel's ***healing touch*** feature, a *lesser restoration* spell, or any other means of curing a disease.

## S4a. Western Temple, Main Floor
### Brewing Room
<span class=”citation”>This scene takes place in Chapter 13, Area X19.</span>

This area is as described in <span class=”citation”>X19. Potion Storage (p. 187)</span>.

### Architect’s Room
<span class=”citation”>This scene takes place in Chapter 13, Area X20.</span>

This area is largely as described in <span class=”citation”>X20. Architect’s Room (p. 187)</span>. However, a player with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 10 or greater observes faint scuff marks along the bottom of the chest. (The marks were left by opening the chest’s false bottom.)

In addition, replace the *tome of understanding* with a set of *eyes of minute seeing*, two old parchment scrolls, a moldy ink bottle, and three old quill pens.

The first scroll contains a precise sketch of an amber sarcophagus, whose front is engraved with the design of a tall, gnarled tree surrounded by stone canals. The sketch is surrounded by lines of complex runes and arcane formulae. (A player who succeeds on a DC 18 Intelligence (Arcana) check identifies the runes and formulae as notes regarding some kind of conjuration magic.) A scrawled note at the bottom of the scroll reads: “Integrity parameter + duplication runes + inversion function = hidden physical demiplane within psychic manifestation. But who, and why?”

The second scroll contains a similar sketch of Castle Ravenloft's <span class=”citation”>K60. North Tower Peak (p. 74)</span>, including<span class="citation>K20. Heart of Sorrow (p. 59)</span> below. A scrawled note at the bottom reads: “Composition: crystallized blood. Means of suspension: Unknown (nonmagical). Notes: Highly conductive to arcane energies, with potentially exceptional storage capacities. Arcane signature resonates with the mists around the valley. Why?” (The last word is underlined three times.)

> [!lore]+ **Khazan’s Notes**
> In the years between Strahd’s fall and Khazan’s own death, Khazan returned to the Amber Temple multiple times to investigate the secrets of lichdom and delve deeper into the knowledge that dwelled there. It was on one such visit that Khazan detected the subtle magical energies emanating from the amber sarcophagus of the Vampyr in <span class=”citation”>X42. Amber Vault (p. 195)</span>. Further investigation revealed the sarcophagus bore a complex and powerful enchantment—one capable of duplicating a sealed vestige’s psychic “mindspace,” stabilizing it as a physical demiplane, and hiding it away within the vestige’s psychic link. However, Khazan never learned of the enchantment’s maker (Patrina) or purpose (to hide the hilt of the broken *Brightblade*).
>
> As Strahd’s arcane advisor, Khazan also returned to Castle Ravenloft on multiple occasions to analyze the Heart of Sorrow, which had mysteriously manifested within the North Tower when the Mists first fell. Centuries later, when Strahd first learned of the Grand Conjunction, Strahd used Khazan’s notes as the basis for his ultimate scheme to channel the Fanes’ power into the Heart of Sorrow —and thereby escape from Barovia.

### West Temple Stair
<span class=”citation”>This scene takes place in Chapter 13, Areas X18 and X21.</span>

This area is as described in <span class=”citation”>X18. Hallway (p. 187)</span> and <span class=”citation”>X21. West Staircase (p. 187)</span>. 

### Dining Hall
<span class=”citation”>This scene takes place in Chapter 13, Area X22.</span>

This area is largely as described in <span class=”citation”>X22. Northwest Annex (p. 187)</span>. However, there are two ewers on the table: the green copper ewer described in <span class=”citation”>X22. Northwest Annex (p. 187)</span>, and an ordinary wooden pitcher. When the *programmed illusion* spell activates, the green copper ewer is disguised to resemble the wooden pitcher, and vice-versa.

In addition, replace two of the **specters** with **wraiths**. The spirits don’t attack if the players pick up the ewer. Instead, safter entering this room, a player with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or greater feels a prickling on the back of their neck, and feels as though they are being watched. A player with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 20 or greater senses an ethereal presence in the room with them. A player who attempts to sense this presence’s disposition and succeeds on a DC 20 Wisdom (Insight) check receives a feeling of wariness and curiosity.

The spirits emerge if a player picks up the ewer or greets the unseen presence and succeeds on a DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check. A player makes the check with advantage if they mention the *Sunsword* or forswear any interest in accepting the vestiges’ gifts. When the spirits appear, read:

<div class="description">
<p>Seven ghostly figures emerge from the walls. Each wears a simple robe, and several carry staves, wands, or books wrapped under their arms. Bloated veins bulge from their pallid, translucent flesh, their faces sagging or frozen in expressions of ghastly horror.</p>
<p>Two of the figures seem darker than the others, their eyes flashing with pale, yellow light. One floats forward, its voice rasping through the air: “Why do you intrude upon the prison of the damned?”</p>
</div>

The two darker figures are the **wraiths**. The others are **specters**. Modify their statistics as follows:

* Each specter can cast *burning hands* once per day. When cast in this way, the spell deals necrotic damage instead of fire.
* Each wraith can cast *counterspell* once per day and *dispel magic* twice per day. When another creature’s spell is countered in this way, the creature must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of its next turn.

> [!lore]+ **The Poisoned Mages**
> When Vilnius poisoned his master, the **archmage** Exethanter, seven other mages—five apprentices and two senior mages—died alongside him. Their spirits live on as the **specters** and **wraiths** that haunt this room, bound to the Amber Temple for eternity by the will of the Dark Powers. 
>
> These spirits remember that they were once members of the secret society that built the Amber Temple, that this society existed to imprison evil vestiges, and that the society’s third generation—theirs—destroyed itself in a storm of paranoia, anger, and greed. The spirits also believe (correctly) that Vilnius, who dined but did not die with them, is the one who killed them. The spirits sense that Vilnius’s spirit is the anchor that traps them here, and wish to see him destroyed so that their souls might be freed. The spirits further know that Vilnius desires his master’s staff (see [[#Shrine of Temptation]]), and, due to their hatred of him, will do anything to stop him from obtaining it.

The spirits are willing to share the following information if asked:

* They are the spirits of mages and apprentices who perished in the Amber Temple long ago.
* The Amber Temple was founded by mages who lived a century before them, who sought to imprison the vestiges of powerful, evil beings so that they would not be resurrected. (The spirits can confirm that these founders’ remains are sealed in [[#S3. Catacombs]].)
* The spirits were murdered by Vilnius, the apprentice to the leader of the Temple's secret order: an archmage named Exethanter. Vilnius did so by poisoning the wine in Exethanter’s ewer.
* If asked why Vilnius killed them, the specters share their belief that he was corrupted by "the call of amber," as so many of their colleagues were "in those final days."

> [!abstract]+ **The Spirits of Amber**
> If any player possesses an amber shard, either openly or secretly, the wraiths sense its presence (though not its precise location) and challenge the players to justify why they carry “a shard of evil’s touch.” 
>
> The players can calm the spirits by succeeding on a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion or Deception) check, made with advantage if they reveal an amber shard and offer it to the spirits, and made with disadvantage if any player has reached Stage Three of an amber shard’s Amber Corruption. On a failure, the spirits warn the players that they cannot allow any who seek the vestiges’ power to depart their chamber alive, and attack.
>
> On initiative count 20 of the first round of combat, the doors leading from <span class="citation">X22. Northwest Annex (p. 187)</span> slam shut and magically lock, requiring a successful DC 20 Strength check to force open.

The spirits won’t share further information (e.g., the location of the *Sunsword) unless the players first destroy Vilnius’s spirit, which resides in <span class=”citation”>X9. Lecture Hall (p. 185)</span>, and retrieve the amulet that he wears. If the players agree to do so, the wraiths instruct them to fill the wooden pitcher with 

The Vilnius Game: The players win if they defeat Vilnius 

If the players ask the wraiths how to enter the sealed treasury, the wraiths agree to share such information if the players first agree to destroy Vilnius's spirit, which resides in [[#Lecture Hall]]. If the players agree to do so, the wraiths instruct the players to take the poisoned wine from the false ewer and deceive Vilnius into drinking it; only this will destroy him and allow the spirits of the Amber Temple to escape the Dark Powers' grasp.

> [!abstract]+ **What the Spirits Know**
> If the players return to the Dining Hall after destroying Vilnius, the wraiths share that the "dusk elf woman" who created the seal on the treasury door opened it by smearing her blood across its surface. "Only her blood can unlock the seal," they inform the players gravely.

The specters can also share the following information with the players:

* There exists a secret staircase that leads from the north side of the statue (the wall in between the two treasuries) up to the Archmage's Quarters, which descends into the Amber Vault where the three most dangerous vestiges were sealed away. However, only the archmage Exethanter knew the password. Although his spirit once dwelled among the Temple, the wraiths haven't seen him in over four hundred years — since Patrina's time.
* The temple has fallen into the grasp of dark powers born from the miasma that gathered in the temple, emanated from the vestiges sealed within. They felt those Dark Powers watching them in their nightmares when they lived, and those same Dark Powers now entrap their souls within the temple's walls in death, as well as the souls of all others who have died here, such as thieves and others who have sought to take advantage of the temple's wealth of knowledge and power and failed.

To convince the specters that they have killed Vilnius, the wraiths ask the players to bring back an amulet that Vilnius carries, which is made of gold and shaped like an upside-down V. (If asked, the specters only share that the amulet once belonged to Vilnius's master, Exethanter, but Vilnius stole it from his master's body following Exethanter's death.)

> [!abstract]+ **Returning with the Staff of Frost**
> If the players re-enter this room while carrying the *staff of frost* from the [[#Shrine of Temptation]], the wraiths and specters manifest and warn the players to abandon the staff, which has been placed where the "betrayer" Vilnius cannot reach it, and return it from whence it came. If the players refuse, the wraiths attack as described above.

### Shrine of Temptation

> * It dispels any magical effect caused by a 1st level spell or lower it comes into physical contact with
> * It has the following curse: If taken beyond the temple by anyone but Vilnius while Vilnius lives, it vanishes and reappears in its original position in the shrine. A person wielding it can't give it up, becomes paranoid, and can't leave the temple willingly or by force while they carry it. If they do, they reappear by the shrine.

This area is largely as described in <span class=”citation”>X5d. Amber Reflections (p. 184)</span> and <span class=”citation”>X36. Lower West Hall (p.194)</span>. However, if any player inspects their reflection, read:

<div class="description">
<p>For a brief instant, a silhouette flickers across the reflection, mere inches behind yours.</p>
</div>

The player must then make a Wisdom (Perception) check. On a result of 15 or greater, add:

<p>The silhouette resembles a tall, dusky-skinned woman, her dark eyes fixed upon yours.</p>
</div>

On a result of 20 or greater, add:

The silhouette vanishes as quickly as it appeared.

> [!info]+ **The Amber Apparition**
> The silhouette belongs to Patrina’s spirit, which has a limited capacity to observe events within the Amber Temple. If asked, Kasimir can confirm, with some surprise, that the silhouette’s features resemble Patrina’s. “But her body lies in Castle Ravenloft’s crypts,” he notes, frowning. “Perhaps it was an echo—a reflection of the temple’s own memory?”

Each time a creature uses a dark gift received from one of the vestiges of the Amber Temple, it must make a DC 10 Charisma saving throw; on a failure, one of the following consequences occurs, based on the creature’s level (or twice the creature’s Challenge Rating, if it doesn’t have a level):

Level 1 or Lower: The creature is overwhelmed by the malevolent power and is immediately transformed into a ghoul.
Level 2 or 3: The creature is overwhelmed by the malevolent power and is immediately transformed into a nothic.
Level 4 or Above: The creature gains an additional stage of corruption, depending on the dark gift it accepted and dictated by the Corruption Table below. Creatures accrue  corruption from different dark gifts separately. (For example, if a creature has two levels of corruption from Fekre’s dark gift and one level of corruption from Drizlash’s dark gift, and that creature fails a saving throw while using Drizlash’s dark gift, the creature now has two levels of corruption from Fekre and two levels of corruption from Drizlash.)

Each time the creature succeeds on the saving throw for a particular Dark Gift, the DC for that Dark Gift’s next saving throw increases by 5. The third time the creature makes a successful saving throw, its new abilities, attributes, and flaws become permanent, and it does not need to make any more saving throws against that Dark Gift.

When a creature accepts a new dark gift, it begins with zero stages of corruption in that specific dark gift. However, it also instantly gains a stage of corruption in every other dark gift it had already accepted. For example, assume that a creature has previously accepted a dark gift from Fekre. If that creature then accepts a dark gift from Drizlash, that creature begins with zero levels of Drizlash’s corruption, but automatically gains one level of Fekre’s corruption. (You might present this as the creature becoming increasingly vulnerable to the vestiges’ dark power, or as a jealous vestige asserting its claim over the creature).

Corruption Table
Wherever a corruption stage lists a specific feature or attack (e.g., the Rotting Presence feature in the second stage of Fekre’s corruption), assume that it uses the same description and statistics as the corresponding feature or attack on the stat block of the creature listed in the third stage of that vestige’s corruption (e.g., the bulezau).

If a creature gains a new attack, but doesn’t have the anatomy necessary to use it (e.g., the Barbed Tail attack in the second stage of Fekre’s corruption), the creature also gains the anatomical features needed to use the attack (e.g., a long barbed tail).

#### Breached Vault
<span class=”citation”>This scene takes place in Chapter 13, Area X33d</span>

This area is largely as described in <span class=”citation”>X33d. Breached Vault (p. 192)</span>. However, remove the **nothics** from this chamber. In addition, revise the sarcophagi in this room (and their dark gifts) as follows.

***West Sarcophagus (Tomb of Delban).*** If a creature touches this sarcophagus, read:

<div class=”description”>
You are mentally transported to a vast, frozen wasteland. Strange, twisted monuments of ice arc unnaturally in leaping spirals and immense, impossible architectures. Shards of ice swirl on the wind, cutting into any exposed flesh. Several hundred yards away rests a near-bottomless pit, its sides covered in snow and frost, its base glowing a faint, weak orange-red several dozen miles below. A constant column of red-hot magma rises in great, shifting blobs from the base of the pit, swirling in a column of air into the skies above.

The column of magma rises far into the atmosphere. As it rises, the magma can be seen darkening, the heat vanishing as it turns black with cold. Above, the magma is devoured by a dark, gaping crater of Delban, the Star of Ice and Hate, an icy, planetary moon that hangs overhead. The crater is lined with enormous, miles-long spikes of ice that rim its edges like teeth.
</div>

Delban offers the creature its dark gift: the power to unleash deadly cold. To accept, the creature must step into the column of magma and allow itself to be devoured by Delban’s crater. This dark gift allows the beneficiary to cast *cone of cold* without components three times per day.

***North Sarcophagus (Tomb of the Devourer).*** If a player approaches this sarcophagus while carrying the figurine of the moth or the twilight crest that Strahd gave them, the item glows purple and emits a soft, keening mournful hum. (The light and hum fade when 1 minute passes or the item is removed from the room.)

> [!lore]+ **The Broken Sarcophagus**
> When the wizards who founded the Amber Temple first set off on their quest to contain the vestiges of evil entities, the vestige of the Devourer — the youngest sister of the Ladies of the Fanes, once known as the Dreamer — was the first that they found. They extracted her divine soul from the Whispering Wall, the site where her corpse lay, and sealed it away inside of her sarcophagus. She became their first prisoner; ever since, a thin layer of mist blanketed the floor of the Temple. When the Dark Powers first formed from the dark miasma of the vestiges' evil, it was the Devourer's mists, ancient and quiet, that they wove into the Mists that entrapped Vilnius and the other souls of the Temple — and which they used as the template for the Mists that would one day, centuries later, rise to imprison the land of Barovia in their grasp.
> 
> For millennia, the vestige of the Devourer slept silently in its sarcophagus... until Strahd von Zarovich came to seek its knowledge of soul magic three months ago. When the Devourer's vestige refused to share its secrets with him, Strahd extracted it from the sarcophagus and sealed it away in the Heart of Sorrow at the peak of Castle Ravenloft, where he could channel the magic of the Fanes that flowed through it to compel her vestige to answer his questions. Now, the only scraps and remnants of the Devourer's power cloak the shattered remnants of her millennia-old prison, echoing faintly with the tinges of the mantle she once wore.

***East Sarcophagus (Tomb of Drizlash).*** If a creature touches this sarcophagus, read:

<div class=”description”>
You are mentally transported to a decrepit stone hall cloaked in thick webbing. The webs are covered in small, silk-woven sacs that range in volume from the size of a fist to that of a humanoid’s head; if broken, they release 3d4 swarms of spiders that escape into the surrounding webbing. The walls and floor are lined with ancient bones marked with the prints of many teeth, and rusted weapons and armor are trapped haphazardly among the webbing.

At the center of the hall looms Drizlash, the Nine-Eyed Spider, an enormous creature with the upper body of an ancient, wizened crone and the lower body of a bloated, spine-covered arachnid. Her pale face has eight visible eyes; when offering her gift, a ninth, blind eye opens atop her forehead.
</div>

She offers the creature her dark gift: the power to walk on walls and ceilings. To accept, the creature must swallow a fist-sized egg sac teeming with infant spiders offered by one of Drizlash’s eight legs. This dark gift allows the beneficiary to cast the spider climb spell three times per day without components.
#### Vault of Harkotha
<span class=”citation”>This scene takes place in Chapter 13, Area X33e</span>

This area is largely as described in <span class=”citation”>X33e. Vault of Harkotha (p. 193)</span>. However, revise the sarcophagi in this room (and their dark gifts) as follows.

***North Sarcophagus (Tomb of Yrrga).*** If a creature touches this sarcophagus, read:

<div class=”description”>
mentally transported to a circular glass platform floating in an endless, starry void. At the center of the platform, upon a raised glass pillar, rests a spherical object covered in a simple red cloth.

The creature is soon met by Yrrga, the Eye of Shadows, a woman’s silhouette formed by the stars and planets of the surrounding void, her eyes a pair of swirling spiral galaxies.
</div>

She offers the creature her dark gift: the power of true seeing. To accept, the creature must remove the red cloth and gaze into the glass orb that lies beneath it. This dark gift grants its beneficiary the ability to cast the true seeing spell three times per day.

***West Sarcophagus (Tomb of Taar Haak).*** If a creature touches this sarcophagus, read:

<div class=”description”>
mentally transported to a desolate wasteland of mountainous canyons, ridges, and chasms that bubble with streams and geysers of lava. A great river of lava cuts through the earth nearby, its surface churning with melting black stone and spouts of hot magma. The river flows into a large lake of lava, framed by a semicircle of five great mountains that tower above the rest.

Rising from the lake of lava is Great Taar Haak, the Five-Headed Destroyer - an immense, five-headed hydra of dark platinum scales, each maw wide enough to devour an entire village.
</div>

***South Sarcophagus (Tomb of Yog).***If a creature touches this sarcophagus, read:

<div class=”description”>
mentally transported to the floor of a dark cavern whose arched ceiling rises hundreds of feet overhead. A stone ridge extends from the floor and extends in dozens of spirals around the edge of the chamber toward the ceiling. The ridges are dotted with enormous boulders, some of which rival entire houses in size, while the smashed remains of many stones of similar size lie pulverized on the ground. The lowest floor of the cavern sinks to a circular, flat depression; at its center, formed by several converging cracks in the earth, rests a deep, dark hole filled with a thick, bubbling tar. 

Perched atop the highest ridge overhead, and slowly descending toward the creature, is Yog the Invincible, a house-sized wolf whose black fur is like a shell of dark, steel quills. A thick, oozing tar constantly drips from Yog’s coat, its yellow eyes gleaming in the darkness of the cave.
</div>
#### Vault of Thangob
<span class=”citation”>This scene takes place in Chapter 13, Area X33f</span>

This area is largely as described in <span class=”citation”>X33f. Vault of Thangob (p. 193)</span>. However, revise the sarcophagi in this room (and their dark gifts) as follows.

***West Sarcophagus (Norganas).*** If a creature touches this sarcophagus, read:

<div class=”description”>
mentally transported to a decrepit chapel carved of black marble. Stone coffins carved with pentagrams fill the sanctuary in long, perfect rows, their covers removed to reveal the ancient undead that lie within. Atop a dais at the opposite end of the chapel lies an additional open stone coffin.

Clad in twisted darkness behind the elevated coffin is Norganas, the Finger of Oblivion, a writhing mass of shadows shaped like grasping hands and long, reaching tendrils. Just above the darkness’ center floats an elaborate helm carved of bone, its visor revealing nothing but a pair of crimson red eyes
</div>

Norganas offers the creature its dark gift: the power to turn life into undeath. To accept, the creature must crawl into the coffin atop the dais and allow Norganas’ many hands to pull the cover shut above it. This dark gift grants its beneficiary the power to cast the finger of death spell as an action once per day.

***South Sarcophagus (Tomb of Vaund).*** If a creature touches this sarcophagus, read:

<div class=”description”>
mentally transported to an impenetrable void of perfect blackness. The floor is wet, as though covered by a thin layer of liquid water. In the distance, a standing silver mirror, taller than the creature, can be seen.

A creature that approaches the mirror, instead of their own reflection, can see a golden mask fashioned into a smiling human face hovering in the air where another creature’s head might be. The rest of the mirror is filled with blackness. This mask hides the features of Vaund the Evasive.
</div>

It offers the creature its dark gift: the power of evasion. To accept, the PC must step through the surface of the mirror. The beneficiary can use this dark gift up to three times per day to either cast the spell nondetection without components or to use their reaction to succeed on a failed Dexterity saving throw.

***East Sarcophagus (Tomb of Seriach).*** If a creature touches this sarcophagus, read:

<div class=”description”>
mentally transported to an arid hellscape forged of black volcanic rock. A crimson sky of impossible heat blazes down from above, and the ground is split in many places by deep fissures and cracks that allow great gouts of lava to burst and ooze from beneath the surface. A pair of hell hounds linger beneath a twisted arch of black earth, smoke and embers steaming from their nostrils as magma drips from their maws like saliva.

Between and behind the hell hounds stands Seriach, the Hell Hound Whisperer, a figure clad entirely in black steel armor inlaid with crimson markings and sigils. The armor upon its shoulders are rimmed with spikes, and its helmet bears a pair of metal horns that thrust into the air a full foot above the helmet’s top. In its hands, Seriach holds a pair of whips that crackle with swirling flames.
</div>

He offers the creature the power to summon and control the beasts of the Nine Hells. To accept, the PC must allow itself to be devoured by the two hell hounds. The beneficiary can use this dark gift to summon and control two hell hounds for one hour once per day.

### Lecture Hall
<span class=”citation”>This scene takes place in Chapter 13, Area X9.</span>

This area is largely as described in <span class=”citation”>X9. Lecture Hall (p. 185)</span>. However, Modify the first sentence of this area's description to replace "brightly lit" with "dimly lit." Add the following sentence to the end of this area's description:

<div class="description">
<p>A thick layer of mists rolls lazily across the floor of this chamber.</p>
</div>

A player with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or greater notices that the mist is flowing up the stairs, rather than down them, and always seems to be flowing from the lectern at the front of the room.

Vilnius has the following statistics:
(Some kind of mage stuff, amorphous like an ooze, can teleport from shadow to shadow, dims nonmagical bright lights in his presence and lights low level like the darkness spell) Can teleport from dim light or darkness to another square of dim light or darkness that he can see. Wields a dagger as well as his spells. His quality has grown much bigger and grotesque and the shield guardian obeys his commands. Note also his bond to the shield guardian as per the guardian statistics and magic item info.

Proceed as follows through this scene:
* If the players ask Vilnius for information, including knowledge regarding entering the sealed Treasury door, proceed to S1a. [[#Obtaining Vilnius Help]]
* If the players anger Vilnius, proceed to [[#Escaping Vilnius's Wrath]]
* If the players attempt to poison Vilnius, as per the wraiths' instructions in [[#Dining Hall]], proceed to [[#Poisoning Vilnius]]
* If the players choose to fight Vilnius, either aggressively or in self-defense, proceed to [[#Fighting Vilnius]]

> [!lore]+ **Vilnius**
> The archmage Exerhanter first discovered Vilnius as a child in the streets of a city while away from the Amber Temple on a recruitment mission. Then, Exerhanter was a senior mage at the temple, and Vilnius an orphaned urchin who had learned to use *mage hand* and *prestidigitation* from scrolls he had pilfered to distract and steal from merchants in the city market. Impressed by the boy's aptitude for magic, Exerhanter invited the boy to become his apprentice. Vilnius, suspicious at the mage's generosity, but eager to escape the city streets, accepted.
> 
> At the Amber Temple, Vilnius grew quickly under Exerhanter's tutelage, devouring his lessons with a hunger that occasionally unnerved his other teachers. Yet Exerhanter grew fond of Vilnius and his intellect, and continued their studies together even after Exerhanter ascended to take the place of Temple archmage when the position was vacated.
>
> Vilnius, however, never entirely escaped the suspicion and self-sufficiency he had learned to nurture on the streets. When the Vestiges of the Temple began to stir in their sleep, and the first rumblings of unrest began to spread through the Temple, Vilnius was among the first to separate himself from the others, leery that any (or all) of them might envy his position as Exerhanter's apprentice and plot to usurp or kill him. It was Vilnius who first secretly convinced his peer, the young wizard (name for wizard), to invade an amber vault and accept the dark gift of the vestige that lay within, hopeful that this crime would eliminate the other man as a rival for Exethanter's favor.
> 
> When the murder happened, Vilnius took it as proof that he had been right and the other wizards could not be trusted. The whisperings of the Vestiges and nascent Dark Powers only drove him deeper into madness and paranoia, accentuating his suspicions, until he grew convinced that Exerhanter himself — after a sharp and fiery argument between the two in which Exerhanter coldly remarked that perhaps he had made a mistake plucking Vilnius from the city streets — meant to dispose of and replace him. That night, when Vilnius and several other apprentices dined with Exerhanter as was customary, Vilnius secretly disguised Exerhanter's enchanted ewer (he's good at illusion magic!) as an ordinary pitcher and disguised a pitcher filled with poisoned wine as the true ewer. The other apprentices died gruesome deaths at the table; only Exerhanter, sensing the danger, stumbled forth from the chamber toward his quarters, only to fall and place his staff upon the statue in the western shrine of temptation as he died. (Replace the two skeletons with his own).
> 
> Vilnius's betrayal crystallized the nascent power of the Dark Powers, who were born from his treachery that night. And jealousy. Vilnius fled from the shrine, terrified that Exerhanter's vengeful spirit lurked there, and hid himself away in the audience hall, where his spirit lingered, wasting away as the years passed, too terrified to venture forth again. He became the Dark Powers' first prisoner, the Amber Temple the first demiplane.
> 
> Since then, Vilnius has become something less than human — and something more. He believes himself to be alive, and fears the dead of the Temple. He dares not venture forth from the Lecture Hall, but is convinced that, if only he could obtain his master's staff, he could walk freely and without fear, too powerful to be challenged.
#### Obtaining Vilnius’s Help
If the players have come looking for information about the Amber Temple, such as the sealed treasury and Patrina's seal, Vilnius can share the following information:

When the players first enter this chamber, if they bear bright lights, Vilnius hisses and shies away from them, hissing that "the light is too bright," and that "something or someone might see."

If any of the players threaten him using an *amber shard*, Vilnius says "you are dead?" Hrm maybe not. Let me reread the Wheel of Time quote.

> [!info]+ **Vilnius’s Shadow
> A player with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 18 or greater notices that Vilnius doesn't cast a shadow. (The DC decreases to 15 if the players force Vilnius into an area of bright light or trick him there.) If the players confront Vilnius regarding his lack of shadow, read:
>
> <div class="description">
> <p>Vilnius nods, and his eyes narrow, his pallid flesh seeming to cling ever-tighter to his sallow, angled cheekbones, clinging so tight the bone of his skull seems to bulge through his skin. He pauses for a moment, tilting his head, as though listening to an unseen voice, and then nods. "So," he says, standing straighter, seeming taller. "It is decided."</p>
> <p>His eyes darken, his sclera blackening to voids, as the mists churn and swirl around him. > The toad upon his shoulder ripples and bloats, its form bubbling and elongating to form a spindly, reptilian, green-scaled creature with spined limbs and a pair of curving, emerald-green horns. As it does, Vilnius's hand clutches an object beneath his cloak that hangs around his neck, which glows with a sickly amber light. From the floor beside him, an enormous, metallic head begins to rise from the mists, followed by steel-forged shoulders, a metal torso, and limbs carved of thick, studded wood.</p>
> <p>"Remove them," Vilnius whispers, his lips barely seeming to move.</p>
>  </div>
> 
> Proceed to [[#Escaping Vilnius's Wrath]]

Vilnius can share the following information:

* His name is Vilnius. He's a resident of the Temple, and is the sole survivor of a terrible calamity that struck its inhabitants.
* He's been here by himself for "a long time," surviving mostly off of rats. "There haven't been many rats for a while now," Vilnius murmurs, his hands trembling. "I've been hungry — so hungry."
* He is terrified of the people and creatures that lurk elsewhere in the Temple, who he believes intend to kill him. "They wear the faces of men," he whispers, "but demons lurk beneath. If you listen, you can hear their bodies shift beneath their flesh, like clothes that don't quite fit."
* Vilnius doesn't dare exit the hall without his master's staff, which lies in the western shrine, at the northwest corner of the temple. "He knew I couldn't follow him there," Vilnius whispers harshly, his hand curling into a fist. "Even in death, he chose to hurt me — trap me here." (If asked, Vilnius can share that his master's name was Exethanter.)
* Vilnius, if asked, claims not to know how his master died. (A DC 11 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals this to be a lie, though Vilnius stubbornly insists it to be the truth, growing irate if the players push back on his story.)

If the players try to befriend him, Vilnius is suspicious of their intentions. However, if the players ask him for knowledge about the Amber Temple, Vilnius agrees to share what he knows if the players fetch his master's staff from [[#Shrine of Temptation]] and return it to him. ("Beware," Vilnius warns them, hoarsely, "for a powerful enchantment protects it.") (Vilnius doesn't remember the enchantment's true nature — only that it is dangerous.)

> [!abstract]+ **Returning with the Staff**
> If the players return to Vilnius after obtaining Exethanter's *staff of frost*, he anxiously and greedily demands that they give it to him immediately. If the players refuse to do so, he howls in rage and attacks them as described above. If the players give him the staff, read:

<div class="description">
<p>An unholy light kindles in his eyes, and Vilnius raises the staff high over his head.</p>
</div>

(When the players first obtain it, the staff whispers to the players, tells them to "take it for themselves," and offers to create an illusion that can fool Vilnius — a duplicate. That's actually rad. Also, the _staff of frost_ can cast the _fabricate_ spell (1 charge, ice only, no raw materials needed, lasts for 10 minutes).

If the players defeat Vilnius, read:

<div class=”description”>
<p>Vilnius throws back his head and wails, dust sifting down as the walls tremble. "You are all dead!" he cries. "All dead!" His form dissolves into shadowed smoke, stretching out and thinning, then flows into a crack in the wall and vanishing into it. A final cry hangs in the room as he vanishes, its echo fading slowly: "You are all dead!"</p>

[^1]: Inspired by *The Eye of the World*, Robert Jordan.

The wraiths inform the players that their spirits can be freed from the Amber Temple only if Vilnius's connection to the Temple is severed and his remnant destroyed. To sever his link to the temple, the players must obtain and destroy his *shield guardian amulet* — a golden v-shaped amulet once worn by the archmage of the temple and leader of the secret society, most recently by a man named Exethanter, Vilnius's master.

Vilnius stole Exethanter's shield guardian amulet while he slept, fearing that his master would turn it against him, but fled when Exethanter stirred, too fearful to linger or attempt to steal his master's *staff of frost*. The players can convince Vilnius to reveal the amulet by succeeding on a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check, succeeding automatically if they (???? idk). They can convince Vilnius to remove the amulet by succeeding on a DC 15 Charisma (Deception) or DC 25 Charisma (Persuasion) check, succeeding automatically if they offer him a magic item of equal or greater value. A player can also pilfer the artifact from Vilnius while he's distracted by succeeding on a DC 13 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, made with advantage if another player succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma (Performance) check to distract him.

***West Sarcophagus (Tomb of Sykane).*** If a creature touches this sarcophagus, read:

<div class=”description”>
mentally transported to a vast, dark graveyard of twisted, decaying vegetation and sunken, crumbling headstones. The sky is covered with flat, grey clouds, and the cemetery is interspersed with tall, cast-iron fences that have rusted and bent with age.

At the center of the graveyard, before an enormous mass grave filled with humanoid corpses, rests Sykane, the Soul Hungerer, an enormous worm with the mouth of a lamprey. Drifting clouds of dim golden mist occasionally drift past its cavernous maw, which it greedily devours whole. Its flesh is not skin, but a writhing mass of millions of tiny earthworms that weave together like fabric.
</div>

It offers the creature its dark gift: the power to raise the recently deceased. To accept, the PC must devour an earthworm from Sykane’s flesh. This dark gift allows its beneficiary to cast the raise dead spell once per day without components as an action.

***South Sarcophagus (Tomb of Zrin-Hala).*** If a creature touches this sarcophagus, read:

<div class=”description”>
mentally transported to an infinite, flat plain of dead vegetation and dry, cracked soil. Overhead, torrential black storm clouds swirl as immense lances of lightning flash across the sky, followed shortly by pounding eruptions of thunder. No rain falls.

Amidst the clouds, at the eye of the storm, hovers Zrin-Hala, the Howling Storm, a massive humanoid apparition formed of dark storm clouds that constantly crackle and hum with lightning. Its lower body is a black tornado that descends to the ground below, carving deep gouges into the landscape. Its hands are long, crackling bolts of lightning, and its mouth is a gaping, dark maw.
</div>

It offers the creature its dark gift: the power to create lightning. To accept, the creature must be speared in the chest with one of Zrin-Hala’s lightning bolts. The dark gift allows its beneficiary to cast the lightning bolt spell as an action without components three times per day.

***East Sarcophagus (Tomb of Fekre).*** If a creature touches this sarcophagus, read:

<div class=”description”>

mentally transported to a vast, dark stone chamber lined with twisted pillars and sculptures of snakes. At the opposite end of the chamber, upon a dais, rests a dark stone altar that bears a porcelain bowl decorated with simple swirling patterns. The bowl is filled with a bubbling purple liquid.

Behind the altar stands Fekre, Queen of Poxes, a tall woman with pallid, purple-grey skin and a dress of deep violet. Her hair resembles a grey-green fungus that extends on either side of her head, and her eyes are covered with a purple fungus that mimics the shape of a masquerade mask.
</div>

She offers the creature her dark gift: the power of spreading disease. To accept, the creature must drink the potion from the ceramic bowl. The dark gift allows its beneficiary to cast the contagion spell as an action without components three times per day.
#### Vault of Maverus
<span class=”citation”>This scene takes place in Chapter 13, Area X33e</span>

This area is largely as described in <span class=”citation”>>X33b. Vault of Maverus</span>. However, revise the sarcophagi in this room (and their dark gifts) as follows.

***North Sarcophagus (Tomb of Savnok).*** If a creature touches this sarcophagus, read:

<div class=”description”>
mentally transported to a circular chamber filled with shelves that groan beneath the weight of arcane components, potions, and devices. The floor, which is forged of glittering lapis-lazuli, is carved in the design of a pentagram. Each of the pentagram’s points bears the sigil of one of the five elements of fire, earth, wind, water, and will. At the center of the room, upon a white marble pedestal, rests an orb carved from an amethyst gem.

Beside the pedestal stands Savnok, the Inscrutable, a figure whose features and limbs are entirely concealed by the long, cowled violet robe that it wears.
</div>

It offers the creature its dark gift: the power to shield the mind. To accept, the PC must place its hand upon the orb upon the pedestal. This dark gift allows the beneficiary to cast the mind blank spell once per day without components.

***South Sarcophagus (Tomb of Tarakamedes).*** If a creature touches this sarcophagus, read:

<div class=”description”>
mentally transported to a vast ossuary built to resemble a throne room forged entirely with bones. Lightless grey flames burn in countless sconces carved from skulls and mounted upon the walls, which themselves are built of interlocking femurs and decorated with rib cages organized in sickening patterns.


At the center of the chamber, behind a throne forged of skulls, ribs, clavicles, and femurs, towers Tarakamedes, the Grave Wyrm, a serpentine wurm with a body formed of jagged grey spikes, its head terminating in a massive, tooth-filled maw that extends beyond the edges of its body, without eyes or other facial features. Twin skeletal wings extend from its back, its vast wingspan brushing the edges of the chamber.
</div>

It offers the creature its dark gift: the power of flight. To accept, the PC must seat itself upon the throne. This dark gift allows the beneficiary to cast the fly spell three times per day without components, manifesting as a pair of skeletal wings

***East Sarcophagus (Tomb of Shami-Amourae).*** If a creature touches this sarcophagus, read:

<div class=”description”>
mentally transported to a lush windowless parlor lit by flickering candlelight and filled with soft pillows, divans, love seats, and futons colored pink, pastel green, and scarlet red.

Upon a futon at the center of the room lies Shami-Amourae, the Lady of Delights. Her beautiful face is painted white, and her lips are a deep, crimson red. Her eyes are jade-green, and her hair is pulled into a simple, yet neat bun atop her head, kept in place by a pair of ivory needles.
</div>

She offers the creature her dark gift: the power of persuasion. To accept, the creature must accept a kiss from Shami-Amourae. This dark gift allows the beneficiary to cast the suggestion spell three times per day without components.

<span class=”citation”>This scene takes place in Chapter 13, Area X33c.</span>

This area is largely as described in <span class=”citation”>X33c. Ghastly Vault (p. 192)</span>. However, remove the **ghasts** from this room. In addition, add the following to the end of this area’s description:

<div class=”description”>
<p>Sitting in the middle of the room is a lone, hunched creature.</p>
</div>

The creature is a **nothic**. When the players first interact with it or otherwise make their presence known, the nothic turns to face them. Read:

<div class=”description”>
<p>Purple spines stick up from this creature’s back, its body lined with warped, ropy muscle. Brown patches cover its leathery flesh, which turns to a light, sickly purple toward the hands, where its crooked fingers end in sharp, hooked talons. A single, large, baleful eye leers from the center of its skull, above a pointed, bony, toothy jaw that drools with a single line of saliva. Something amber glints from a cord curled in its right hand.</p>
</div>

> [!lore]+ **The Nothic**
> The nothic is <that mountain folk girl>, who accepted the dark gift of Khirad, the Star of Secrets. Upon accepting his gift, her mind was overcome by the power of the knowledge he shared, and her body was magically corrupted and twisted into its current form. <name> has lost her sanity and lost herself to madness, and no longer cares for anything but her own curiosity and mirth at what she discovered, though she cannot put it into words.

Meda greets the players crazily, leering at them and giggling. If asked whether her name is Meda, she ponders it for a moment, then giggles, saying it "sounds familiar," but she has so much more interesting things to think about. She acts largely as described in X33d. Breached Vault, but giggles about the grand conjunction if asked what other "interesting things" she's learned. If asked, she can share the following information:

* She sought out the gift of the Star of Secrets because she wanted "answers." (If asked, she sweeps her claws out to the room around her and crows, "This! All of this. Answers to it all. And I got them." "And they were —" she shudders "— delicious.")
* Khirad "showed her the truth" — "the veil, the mist that lurks and watches and devours and _waits_. The undying mist, the ones who watch from afar, who are all around us and beyond, who peer through the bars of the cage they've forged. The ones who are powerless and yet all-powerful. And the prisoner, the rat in the cage, who dances and capers for their amusement." She giggles again. "But the day is coming when the cloth over the cage will slip. The day is coming when the candle will tip, and the rat will burn through the cage. The stars are stirring, they are waking up. Soon, all shall commune. All shall _touch_. And won't it be _beautiful_."

<p>Piles of amber are heaped against the west and east walls of this stone room. The east wall holds an additional pile: a mound of treasure.</p>
</div>

A player who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check estimates that each pile contains approximately fifty thousand such chunks. Each pile of amber is made up of fist-sized chunks of amber, with an overall diameter of four feet and a height of three feet.

The pile of treasure includes:
* All cp and gemstones from Pile 1
* All sp and the silvered rapier from Pile 2
* All ep from Pile 3
* The trunk, jewelry, gp, and ceramic statues from Pile 3
* The iron ingots, holy symbols, copper chalices, gilded skull from Pile 4
* The sp, crystal balls, bronze crown, and marble vases from Pile 5
* The cp, obsidian scepter from Pile 6

In addition, the **amber golem** attacks any creature that disturbs the pile of treasure or approaches the crack in the wall. Modify the golem's statistics as follows:
* Same Slow bonus action modifier as above
* Double its HP

> [!lore]+ **The Treasury**
> The amber within this treasury was melted down and reforged into the amber sarcophagi, which were then used during the binding ritual in <whatever room i used for this>, as well as the two **amber golems** built to guard the temple. The treasure served as the secret society's treasury, funding their expeditions and supplies, as well as providing a stipend for society members and remittances to their families.
## S6c. Amber Vault
<span class=”citation”>This scene takes place in Chapter 13, Areas X41 and X42.</span>

This area is largely as described in <span class=”citation”>X41. Fissure (p. 195)</span> and <span class=”citation”>X42. Amber Vault (p. 195)</span>. However, modify the east and south sarcophagi as follows:

***East Sarcophagus.*** A creature that touches this sarcophagus is mentally transported to the crest of a tall, mountainous hill that overlooks a rugged and desolate landscape. Cold, raised lines of pale blue curl between each mountain, splitting and rejoining like veins. The sky overhead is an inky black, filled only with thirteen distant stars whose blue light flickers coldly across the void.

As the creature obtains its bearings, the hill splits apart at its peak, revealing its true nature: one of the many, miles-long eyes of Zhudun, the Corpse Star - an aberrant moon-sized planetary body covered in eyes. Dozens, then hundreds of mounds, mountains, and hills across the horizon, as far as the eye can see, do the same, revealing hundreds of purple-irised eyes, each one larger than a city. 

Zhudun offers the creature its dark gift: the power to animate the ancient dead. To accept, the creature must allow itself to fall into the great dark hole of Zhudun’s pupil.

> [!info]+ **Zhudun’s Gift**
> A creature that accepts Zhudun’s gift gains the power to perform the Rite of Stolen Life once per day, which is largely as described in <span class=”citation”>Rite of Stolen Life (<em>Tomb of Annihilation (p. 73)</span>. However, a character transformed by this ritual into the walking dead has Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores of 6, and none of its former personality, and obeys its creator without question.

***Tenebrous’s Sarchopagus.*** A creature that touches this sarcophagus is mentally transported to a dark tomb, the walls lined with twisted engravings of undeath and sacrilegious, profane arcane rites. A pair of pedestals carved from enormous, powder-white bones hold a pair of objects: one, an ancient grimoire bound in human skin; the other, a small metal box inscribed with hundreds of intertwining, concentric arcane symbols.

Between the pedestals stands Tenebrous, a towering undead figure whose flesh has decayed and shriveled, leaving its features sunken, twisted, and sagging. Six red circles have been carved into the flesh of its bare scalp, and its eyes glow a dim, distant crimson. On a loop of platinum chain links around its neck, it wears a simple amulet forged of platinum and bearing a purple gem at its center. Tenebrous offers the creature its dark gift: the secret of lichdom, as described in the original module. To accept, the creature must open the grimoire upon the pedestal and read its contents. 

> [!warning]+ **Liches Have Standards**
> Remember that Tenebrous won’t offer its dark gift to any creature except a wizard capable of casting ninth-level spells.

### The Vampyr’s Sarcophagus
#### Gift of the Vampyr
A character that touches Vampyr's sarcophagus, read:

<div class="description">
<p>You are mentally transported to a stone platform floating in a dark, endless void. Dead, yellow grasses stand still like silent statues with nary a gust of air to disturb them. Black roots run across the stone, cracking the stonework and weaving between the cracks, curling upward into the air like claws. The roots emanate from a tall, black tree, surrounded by a cracked, bone-dry channel that runs off the side of this thirty-foot-square platform that seems suspended in the endless abyss. A single, perfect, beautiful red apple grows from the lowest-hanging branch, juicy and waiting to be plucked.</p>

<p>A knot across the tree's trunk stirs, and what you'd taken to be a mere bulge around the tree's middle reveals itself to be an enormous black snake, as thick as a man's torso. Its eyes are a deep, flickering crimson, and a night-black tongue flickers forth from its fanged mouth, tasting the air.</p>

<p>Around you, the void swirls with an odd, pearlescent mist that seems to murmur with many echoing voices. Strange shapes seem to occasionally form within the mist, before dissipating once more into the writhing morass.</p>
</div>

The serpent is the vestige of **Vampyr**. It welcomes the player to its domain and congratulates them on their strength of will and ambition in seeking out its power. It can share the following information:

It is the Vampyr, the gifter of eternal life. Its gift is that of eternal life through perfect undeath — to remain as you are, not rotted away like a lich. To take who you are on this day, at this instant, and preserve that beauty and intellect and strength — forever.

The void around it is filled with the shrieking souls of mortals who have died. "They have tasted Death," Vampyr purrs, "and wish to be free of it. But they have not tasted my gift, and so they are chained to the grave for eternity. Only those who receive my gift may roam free, unshackled from the worms and earth."

To accept its gift, a player must merely taste of the apple that grows upon the tree. "One bite," the Vampyr purrs, "and you shall know of the secrets of eternal life."

If the player rebuffs the Vampyr's invitations, it laughs darkly and asks the player if they know what comes after death. Regardless of the player's response, the Vampyr taunts the player with the fact that their body shall rot in the ground, food for naught but worms, their legacy shall tarnish and age and break over time, and within a century, if not less, none shall live who remember or speak of them (maybe longer for elves). "Your legacy shall die," the Vampyr whispers. "You shall die again — and now, permanently. It shall be as though you never walked the earth at all. Even should your spirit be taken by some deity to the choruses of the Upper Planes, your being shall stagnate; you shall no longer learn or grow, or accomplish anything of note. You shall be apart from the change and energy and life that made your existence worth being. And should you find yourself instead amidst the Lower Planes..." The Vampyr chuckles. "Then you may wish you had never been born at all."

If a player approaches the void of souls, read:

<div class="description">
<p>A churning sea of ethereal figures swims amidst the black void, their limbs and claw-like fingers stretching forth toward you in desperate suffering. Beneath them, a weak golden light emanates from the space beneath the platform. Rather than falling away into the void (do I want to keep this?), the streams of crimson water bend toward the space beneath the pavilion, where they vanish from sight.</p>
</div>

A player who jumps, leaps from the platform into the sea of souls, flies through them, or teleports to the bottom side of the platform enters [[#The Stolen Sword]].
#### The Stolen Sword
When a player first enters this area, read:

<div class="description">
<p>Gravity is reversed on the bottom side of the platform.

Gravity reverts, and you find yourself pulled to the lower side of the stone platform. This side of the platform is a reflection of the other — but its ancient, cracked channels are empty and dry, its grasses a pale, tender green that seem to stand silently still, as if waiting for a breeze to lift their heads to the sky. No black roots pierce through the stones of this pavilion. Instead, where the black tree rises on the other side, a simple stone plinth rises: a carved stone pedestal no more than four feet in height. An old, lavender cloth lies across its surface, holding a sword's broken platinum hilt. The hilt gleams in the dim light, its brilliant metal untarnished by age or element. Its crossguard curves upward like eagle's wings, flaring sharply around a sapphire that glints dully in the grey light, surrounded by a wrought guard shaped like a sunburst, with sharp elegance around the sapphire.</p>
</div>

If a player picks up the hilt or otherwise inspects it, read:

<div class="description">
<p>The hilt of the blade has been broken. A half-inch of jagged crystal thrusts forth from the platinum hilt.</p>
</div>

When a player picks up the blade, the sapphire at its center kindles to life, a faint shimmer glowing within it. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>You feel a shifting presence touch your thoughts — a sense of fierce, piercing joy.</p>
</div>

> [!info]+ **Patrina's Phylactery**
> At the time the players first obtain the hilt of the *Sunsword*, it serves as an unfinished phylactery for Patrina's soul, containing her spirit. While Patrina's soul resides within the blade, it has the properties of the Sunsword as a sentient weapon, as described in <span class="citation">Sunsword (p. 223)</span>, except its properties as a *sun blade* can't be used. While possessed by Patrina's spirit in this way, the *Sunsword* is a neutral evil weapon with an Intelligence of 20, a Wisdom of 17, and a Charisma of 16. It otherwise has the same sentience as the *Sunsword*, though Patrina pretends to have the personality described in <span class="citation">Sunsword (p. ???)</span> in order to convince the players to bring her out of Vampyr's sarcophagus.

As the player bearing the *Sunsword's* hilt exits through the stone archway, read:

<div class="description">
<p>You feel a second stab of fierce, rippling joy—followed by deep, malevolent satisfaction.</p>
</div>

### Patrina’s Revenge
When a player returns from the archway in #The Stolen Sword, they find themselves back in their body, but now holding the hilt of the *Sunsword*. The first time the Sunsword's carrier shows it to the other players, or attempts to leave the room with it, read:

<div class="description">
<p>The hilt stirs in your grasp—then violently. The sapphire at the center of its guard shimmers—then flares a deep, malevolent violet. A thin stream of shadow floods forth from the sapphire, gathering and rising in the air until it forms a feminine silhouette—a tall, slender woman with long, raven-black hair, dusky skin, and pointed ears.</p>

<p>"Now that's better," she purrs, extending her arms and admiring her fingers and palms. "It's been so *long* since I last tasted fresh air."</p>
</div>

Kasimir, shocked, recognizes Patrina.

Any player with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 12 or greater notices that the woman has a noticeable resemblance to Kasimir's features.

Patrina greets the players grandiosely, thanking them for freeing her from her "lengthy imprisonment." "You've truly no idea of how *unpleasant* it is to have your soul stuck within an inanimate object for nearly four hundred years—least of all an inanimate object hidden inside of an isolated demiplane, with no creature to talk to but the maddened ghost of the first creature that sought bloodsucking was some groundbreaking new idea."

Patrina is glad to share the following information if prompted or asked:

* She is Patrina Velikovna, the sister of Kasimir Velikov, and a dusk elf
* Patrina taunts Kasimir. "Oh, dear Kasimir," she tuts. "Fratricide can truly be a weight upon one's soul—and not to mention *so unbecoming*." She spreads her hands, shadows wisping through the air to form a cloak around her shoulders. "But fear not, little brother. I'm pleased to share that I've decided upon a way for you to suitably apologize—yourself and your little new friends as well."

If the players express an interest in Patrina's current state, she can share the following story:

Patrina can share the following information:

* More than four hundred years ago, "as my baby brother no doubt has told you," Old King Barov of the von Zarovich family decided to shake down the dusk elves for "pocket change." "Dear Uncle Erevan didn't like that," she says, showing white teeth in a grim, predatory smile. "And Barov didn't like that he disliked it. And so dear Uncle Lion Cub found his family put to the sword, babes dashed across the walls—you know, how it goes in war."

* "It was in the aftermath of Erevan's downfall that dear Kasimir and I came of age," she continues. "Imagine this: You're a dainty, naive, young girl scarcely eighty years old, and all you see around you are your own beloved people, their backs breaking in Old King Barov's labor camps. What's a girl to do?"

* Whether the players respond or not, Patrina continues: "My little escapades, of course, did not serve me well—nor those of my countrymen. I won't claim the glory or honor of being the first to organize my people, but I'd gladly claim the glory of being among the first to answer the call to battle when Barov fell and his son took the throne." She chuckles darkly, a low, throaty sound. "We thought him a naive starling—scarcely fifty summers old. How wrong we were."

* "He broke us again, of course. Left us to the mercy of his favorite little travelers—the Vistani, who you may have met. Did you know that's where the name 'Velikov' comes from?" "Dear Kasimir feared that Strahd might crush us if he learned of our relationship to dear Uncle, and suggested we take the name of the man whose caravan had taken us in."

* "Of course, when the Vistani bore us to the valley, it soon became clear that this was to be our prison—no, our graves. For Strahd's forces had encircled us, and it was inevitable his gaze would one day turn back to our new home, as it had all the others. But a chance encounter with a knight wearing a dragon's coat of arms, a few drinks, a slip of his tongue, and a little bit of enchantment led to a few slips of the tongue that taught me about a temple high in the mountains—one that could hold the secrets to excising Strahd the scourge of the von Zaroviches and returning my people to their proper place."

* She sniffs. "Of course, the old ghost I found here was suspicious about me—but even he crumbled in the end. I had an entire playground of new magic—*dark* magic—to explore, and I knew that another stupid, selfish old man wasn't about to stop me from getting what was mine."

* She shrugs. "So I studied. I learned. I waited. And by the time he found out... Well, by then, it was too late, wasn't it?"

* "With dear Exethanter gone," she continues, "the future was mine for the taking. The vestiges that dwell here—most are pathetic, offering only scraps of power, but one..." She shudders with delight. "One offered *so much more*. Perhaps you've encountered it?"

* If a player offers any name but "Tenebrous," Patrina is irritated and snaps, "A fool's answer. No, I speak of the vestige of Tenebrous—the gatekeeper of *true* power." If the player names Tenebrous, she nods smugly with a delighted smirk. "Oh, yes. And it wasn't power that would claim and devour me, like so many of these other weaklings offered. No; this was power that had to be *earned*. And I knew I wasn't yet worthy of it."

* "In the meantime," Patrina continues, "dear Strahd came to the valley, as I'd long expected. By now, I'd done some growing up myself. I'd realized, of course, that von Zarovich himself was only a man—a puppet of the age. If I were to kill him, one of his generals would rise up to take his place. My people would still be encircled, bullied, weak, squabbling for scraps. No; I realized that if I wanted to win my people the future they deserved, I needed to *use* that throne Zarovich had erected—not merely vacate it."

* "Strahd may have been mature for a human," Patrina continues, "but he was so transparently *mortal*, as all humans are. So terrified of death and age; it was a simple thing to prey upon that, to tug on it, to nurture it until it was a monster ready to devour his heart. He would have done anything to escape it, then—and I gave him a way out." (Patrina is referring to the Amber Temple.)

* "He joined me to visit the Temple—at my invitation, of course. He communed with Tenebrous as I had—though he insisted upon learning of the other vestiges within the temple's vault. His own humble curiosity, he assured me; a general, wishing to know of other threats and opportunities. I indulged his whims, a mistake I now regret."

* "You may understand my shock, then, when he denied Tenebrous's gift. He claimed, at least for now, that he had too many matters in his empire to tend to to further delve into the study of magic. I thought it a trick of the light, but there was a glint of hunger in his eyes as he beheld the Vampyr's sarcophagus."

* "And then—the Federovna girl." Her mouth twists in distaste. "His darling little brother, the accursed prince, finds this comely little village girl and spirits her away to the castle. Strahd spent all of his time pursuing her, entertaining the happy couple—but I knew the lust in his eyes for what it was. Our lessons in magic dwindled, and soon ceased. I *bored* him now; here, he had found a treasure that surpassed any I could offer him. And then—the wedding. The day the skies turned red. The day he ascended far beyond what I had become."

* "I redoubled my studies of the dark arts. I knew that he had now grown beyond my power to control. And so I began to pursue Tenebrous's gift more vigorously—until, soon, I had assembled all of the pieces I needed to finalize its enactment."

* "Tell me," she asks, "do you know the two ingredients of lichdom?" She laughs. "It's simple, really: a prepared phylactery—an object that shall house your soul, and a potion of undeath (check name?). The former, I had already prepared. Oh, it was a *delight* to think of housing my soul in the one thing that had, until recently, struck fear in the undead Strahd's heart—his father, then brother's blade of searing sunlight, enchanted and wrought from unbreakable platinum. And to hide it away in the one place where he would never return, so devoid of sentiment as he was, and in the one place he would fear to tread, so terrified of death even beyond the grave?"

(No vampire spawn or crates lie in this room.)

When Patrina has finished sharing her tale, when she tires of the players' conversation, or when the players first move to depart the room or attack her, read:

<div class="description">
<p>Patrina waves her hands — and the amber-covered wall tentacle carvings stir, then grind like stone as they twist to cover the exits, blotting out the light from beyond.</p>
<p>The light in the room seems to shrink, as the shadows cloaking Patrina's form seem to grow.</p>
</div>

Patrina informs the players that her efforts to attain lichdom were disrupted by her brother, Kasimir. "Betrayed and killed before I could drink the potion that was to be my greatest triumph," she says, her lips twisting. "Eight lives, sacrificed to brew it — wasted." She scoffs, tossing her hair across her shoulders, and smiles hungrily toward the players. "Fortunately, I've thought of a way that my dear brother can apologize to me — and he's even brought friends to help him do so."

Read:

<div class="description">
<p>With a crook of her fingers, the Sunsword shudders — then the sapphire within its guard darkens to a deep, virulent purple. Tendrils of lavender shadow lurch from its depths, bonding to each of you in turn!</p>
<p>Patrina smiles delightedly. "Fortunately, I have all of the souls I need to finish what I started right here — and I've had nearly four centuries to make the preparations."</p>
</div>

Patrina then attacks.

> [!info]+ **Reversed Private Sanctum**
> Upon her manifestation, Patrina silently inverts the *private sanctum* spell enchantment overlaying the rear areas of the Amber Temple, thereby preventing any creatures from teleporting *out* instead of *in* (and inverting all other effects of the spell).

If asked, Patrina is glad to share her plans:
* Today, she'll drain the players' souls into the Sunsword, thereby allowing her to regain a body and complete her transformation into a lich.
* Once she's done so, she'll consolidate her power within the Amber Temple, recover her spellbook, and find Strahd. "I shall find the source of his power over this land," she breathes, her eyes wide with delight, "take that power from him, and extinguish him. In place of a lord, the people of this land shall know a queen — and the dusk elves shall rise again to sit atop the world, as we were destined to be."

Patrina then turns to Kasimir. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>Patrina turns her head to Kasimir, and her expression softens. "Kas," she murmurs, tracing a finger along his shoulder. "Think of what our people have suffered. Leave these outsiders to their fate, and join me to fight for a better future — for our people, for the losses we've suffered, and to avenge the wrongs done to us all."</p>
</div>

As the conversation unfolds, Patrina works to sway Kasimir away from the players. If the players work to discourage him from joining Patrina, secretly place a six-sided die (persuasion die) on the table out of the players' view. Set the die's starting value as follows:

* If the players have made significant efforts to befriend Kasimir, start the die at four.
* Otherwise, start the die at three.

Each time the players and Patrina make opposing arguments, have one of the players make a Charisma (Persuasion) check contested by Patrina's roll, made with advantage if the players appeal to Kasimir's hope for a brighter future and encourage him to let go of the ghosts of his past. Each time Patrina wins a contested check, decrement her die by one. Each time the players win a contested check, decrement Patrina's die by one. Decrement the loser's die by two if their roll was defeated by 10 or more.

If the players' social die reaches zero before Patrina's, Kasimir joins Patrina and helps her defeat the players in combat. "I'm sorry," he says, his face stricken. "But I already lost my sister once. I can't lose her again."

Patrina promises Kasimir that, when she ascends to lichdom and takes Strahd's place, she'll be able to use the power of the Amber Temple to resurrect all of the women Rahadin slaughtered long ago. "Think of it," she whispers into his ear. "Every mother, wife, sister, and daughter lost that day — returned to live the lives they were always meant to. Redemption for our people." (A player who succeeds on a DC 17 Wisdom (Insight) check discerns that Patrina's lips twist slyly at her suggestion, and her eyes glint with amusement at the mention of "resurrecting" the fallen dusk elves.) (Patrina is lying.)

In combat, Patrina has the following abilities:

Phase One:
* As an action, attack with the tentacles surrounding her current position
* As a bonus action, animate two **small amber golems** from the Treasury
* As a bonus action, she fades into the walls and reappears in location
* As a reaction when attacked, she can move to a new hiding place and immediately take the Hide action, taking the place of a Queen, pharaoh, or sultan (one of five)
* As part of her multiattack, Patrina can cast *dominate person*, *evard's black tentacles*, *regal presence*
* As a reaction when someone approaches her in melee, she can try to use a tentacle to swat them away
* She can only teleport to a new location at the end of another creature's turn as a reaction
* At initiative count 20 of each round, each player must succeed on a DC ??? Constitution saving throw or have their hit point maximums reduced by ???, as their vital energies are drained into the sapphire in the Sunsword's guard. A creature dies if its maximum hit points are reduced to 0 by this effect. Its maximum hit points are restored with Patrina's death.

In Phase 2, Patrina's spirit teleports the Sunsword to the center of the room or another suitable place (such as atop the stairs). Read:

<div class="description">
<p>Her spirit takes corporeal form, with sunken, pale flesh stretched thin over skeletal features, a lavender dress spun from shadows whispering in the air around her as she clutches the Sunsword in her hands, a blade of pure darkness sprouting from its hilt. "I had hoped not to take corporeal form, or spend what vitality I'd drained from you," she hisses disapprovingly, "but I suppose the dregs of your souls will have enough left in them to complete my transformation once I've dispatched you."</p>
</div>

Phase Two abilities:
* In combat, she multiattacks with the Sunsword, teleporting from place to place as reactions, parrying as a reaction, casting the *blight* spell as a bonus action or *synaptic static*
* She can also cast bullets of darkness at the players
* She no longer drains players in the room, but any light source that approaches her is dimmed by one level if it approaches within 30 feet, and two levels if within 10 feet
* A creature carrying a light source can cause it to regain its full brightness by invoking a symbol or phrase of hope and succeeding on a DC 15 Charisma or Wisdom (Persuasion or Performance) check, succeeding automatically if they bear Argynvost's weapon or the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind
* In this phase, Patrina has total immunity to all damage while in darkness, resistance to damage in dim light, and takes damage normally in bright light

When Patrina's second phase is defeated, the Sunsword's hilt clatters to the ground, its light gone from its sapphire gem, and all sentience banished from its hilt.
### Exethanter’s Return
When the players defeat Patrina, they see a flash of lavender light from <span class="citation">X30. Preserved Library (p. 189)</span> upstairs.
### Igniting the Sunsword
A player who inspects the Sunsword and casts the *identify* spell, succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check, or attempts to attune to it or learn its properties over a short rest, discerns that a radiant power lingers within the blade, but lacks the necessary spark to kindle it to life — a spiritual force to direct the energy within. A creature that succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check or casts the *identify* spell discerns that the blade derives its power from a soul contained within it — and that, currently, no such spirit dwells within the blade. (Exethanter can provide the same information.) A player who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check recalls that certain souls can be recalled from across the veil of undeath, especially those that linger with unfinished business in the Material Plane — but only one with a suitably radiant soul, one compatible with the Sunsword's own radiant nature, can channel its power to the fullest extent. (If the players appear stumped, Ezmerelda and Exethanter can suggest using a seance to find a suitable soul.)

If the players ask Ezmerelda to conduct a seance, she asks them to find a suitable space where they can conduct the seance in a quiet, dark, safe location. To carry out the seance, Ezmerelda must draw a chalk circle on the ground and ignite five candles — one at each point of the pentagram. As the seance begins, read:

"Spirits," Ezmerelda murmurs, swaying faintly. "We seek a radiant soul—one whose spirit shines like the sun. Aid us, come to us, so that we may see your light, and so give shape to your spirit."

There is a pause — and then the temperature plunges, your skin prickling fiercely. The air around you darkens, the shadows creeping forward, until the surroundings seem to fall away entirely, leaving you in an inky void. Intangible, ethereal, amorphous figures push against the edges of the circle, their faces shifting, unreadable, as they silently plead for an opportunity to be allowed inside.

Ezmerelda's eyes widen at the sight of them. "Three have answered our call — but that does not mean that all are suitable. You may ask three questions of each spirit," she says, gritting her teeth. "They may lie to you, however. Embodiment is a gift that many spirits seek — even embodiment in a weapon such as this is enough to tempt many spirits, who dwell at the edges of the Ethereal. Interrogate them carefully, and do not make your choice lightly."

The three spirits are:
* Baba Zelenna, a powerful Barovian witch and former devotee of Baba Lysaga who betrayed her mentor
* Brother Grigori, the cleric of the Morninglord
* Prince Sergei von Zarovich, Strahd's younger brother and the former Most High Priest of the Church of the Morninglord before his resignation

The players may ask each spirit three questions before the seance ends. ("I can only hold it for so long," Ezmerelda grunts, gritting her teeth, "and the presence of additional spirits increases the strain.") The spirits generally answer as follows:

* Baba Zelenna attempts to present herself as a "devoted follower of the gods," though she refuses to specify which god she follows. She claims to have wielded much power in life, and promises that if she is selected, she will empower the players and deliver them victory over their enemies.
* Brother Grigori insists that he is a humble priest of the Morninglord — a man of faith who, in life, sought to protect his people from the Devil Strahd. He insists that he is wise in the ways of the Morninglord, and that he can guide the players' sword with his wisdom and faith.
* Sergei shares, abashedly, that in life he was the Most High Priest of the Morninglord's church. "I resigned my position to be with the woman I loved," he confesses freely. "I sought to be free of the legacy my father had prepared for me, and love called to me above all other things." Sergei makes clear that he made mistakes in life, and that he believes that by aiding the players, he can atone for his mistakes.

The spirits identify themselves as "Sister" Zelenna, Brother Grigori, and "Sergei," respectively, though if asked, Sergei does not deny his identity. "I have made many mistakes," he says calmly. "My failure to see my brother's torment was one of them. In death, I wish for nothing more than to help him find the peace he has long deserved."

If the players select Baba Zelenna or Brother Grigori and attempt to activate the Sunsword, the sapphire cracks as the spirit within is violently ejected. The second time this occurs, the Sunsword is broken forever. (Ezmerelda can repeat the seance the following day.)

If the players invite Sergei's spirit into the blade, it gains the full properties of the <span class="citation">Sunsword</span>. The first time the players activate its radiant blade, read:

<div class="description">
<p>From the jagged, crystalline shards atop the hilt springs a blade of pure sunlight — a hot, bright gold that scales up toward white, alive, awake, and aware, striking through the darkness and banishing the shadows, beholding the creatures around it, and watching and considering, cheerfully, gravely, something that would kill any creature set before it, to do its job — to find the darkness, pierce it, and be its end.</p>

### Exethanter’s Hospitality

Players who ascend the stairs, add the following to the end of this area's description:

<div class="description">
<p>The ethereal, translucent spirit of an elderly man with a long, white beard and a pointed, jet-blue hat with a wide brim sits in a squashed, comfortable-looking armchair, looking faintly befuddled.</p>
</div>

If the players approach Exethanter or reveal themselves, Exethanter greets them with some surprise. He can share the following information:

* His name is Exethanter. In life, he was an archmage and leader of the Society of Amber, a secret society of mages that guarded the Amber Temple.
* He can further share the information in the lore infobox about the history and downfall of the Amber Temple.
* As the Temple descended further into chaos and paranoia, he attempted to continue hosting dinners with the apprentices and other mages — but even he couldn't resist using one of the odd relics he'd picked up, a wine thing that magically transmuted any poisoned liquid into delicious wine. ("Looking back on it now, it astounds me how deeply the vestiges' darkness had penetrated my mind." He massages his ghostly temples, adding: "It's truly astounding how much clarity death can offer you when you've died and become a ghost.")

If asked, Exethanter denies any knowledge of “Heinrich Stolt,” noting that he has never heard of such an individual.

If asked how the vestiges became so powerful, Exethanter is glad to share his theory: "Ah, yes. Tell me, do you know why my predecessors constructed this temple from amber — everything, its sarcophagi, golems, even its very walls?" A player who succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check recalls that amber is a kind of magical insulator, preventing dark negative energy from seeping through it. "As the logic went, the amber sarcophagi would keep the vestiges' magic entrapped within. Any shreds of power that escaped during the transportation or sealing process, as well as any that might leak out over time, would be concealed from tracking and divination by the amber shields coating the walls. The golems, too, would be protected from vestige interference, their command matrices buried within their amber shells." 

Unfortunately, he continues wryly, "they — and I should add, we — failed to account for the leakage from the sarcophagi. With the amber shielding around the walls, the dregs of darkness that slowly leaked from the sarcophagi had nowhere to go — and over years, then decades, accumulated within the Temple's walls invisibly until they formed a deep, corrupting miasma that we swam in. And it happened so gradually, it was like boiling a frog in a pot slowly. We saw darkness amidst the vestiges, but did not notice the darkness around us because we lived in it — swam in it, breathed it. Like fish in water, we couldn't name the thing that we breathed in, that choked us every day of our lives. We became inured to it — and it wormed its way deeper into our minds."

If the players ask Exethanter about the Tome of Strahd or the ritual to speak with the Ladies of the Fanes, Exethanter perks up. He can share the following information:

* One day, Patrina came to the Temple and found his spirit dwelling there. Lonely and trapped within the demesne that the Dark Powers had created, he fell perhaps too easily for her tales of innocent interest in magic and the tragic fate of her people. "Perhaps I should have seen the darkness in her," he murmurs, pushing the half-moon spectacles up his nose, "but dwelling for so long amidst the darkened Temple had numbed my senses to it."
* "I took her under my tutelage under one condition — that she keep away from the vestiges that dwelled in the sarcophagi, and that she not touch any book I had not permitted her to." He coughs, adjusting his spectacles. "Needless to say, I eventually found she had broken both of these commandments — but by then, she had learned enough and grown in power that it was too late. When I confronted her and demanded she depart the Temple, she laughed and bound me within a sealing circle — a design of my own making, so much the more insulting. She summoned me occasionally after that, as did her student, Strahd von Zarovich. The same bindings that sealed me allowed her — and, later, he — to compel me to share what I knew. When Patrina ceased coming, Strahd von Zarovich followed — and he bade me to share what I knew of binding magic, leylines, and rituals. I never quite learned what he needed that knowledge for."

If the players ask Exethanter to discuss the Tome of Strahd or ask for the ritual to commune with the Ladies Three or other vestiges of ancient gods, Exethanter invites the players to discuss the matters further in his quarters. (If the players assent, Exethanter walks through the wall to reach it, then returns and apologizes to the players, having forgotten that they aren't ghosts like him, and points out the two secret doors en-route. As they pass through, Exethanter apologizes for the “proliferation” of secret doors throughout the temple, noting that it was built as a citadel to withstand any siege, including means of hidden, speedy transportation that wouldn’t require the expenditure of magic. As they pass through, Exethanter points out an additional secret door on the north end of the corridor, noting its use to carry out the rituals that sealed the vestiges in amber upon their transportation to the Temple. If asked, he is glad to allow the players to explore it.) 

If the players give Exethanter the Tome of Strahd, he inspects it for a few moments, using his ghostly *mage hand* to flip through the pages while stroking his beard thoughtfully. "I'm afraid I'm not intimately familiar with this cipher," he says, "but I enjoyed a hobby of cryptography in my youth, and the structure here is similar to some ciphers I have read of in the past. If you leave this with me, I should require no more than — oh, forty-eight hours to crack it." (Exethanter promises to communicate his findings to the players via *sending* once he cracks the code and analyzes the formulas within.)

Exethanter informs the players that one can commune with or conjure the diminished essence of a divine vestige or other vestige by enacting a rite documented in a book sitting on his lectern, which is also his spellbook. (The players, he promises, are free to copy the spells therein for their own use if they wish to.)

> [!info]+ **The Rite of Conjured Divinity**
> The Rite of Conjured Divinity, which the Amber Society used to conjure the essences of vestiges they intended to seal away, requires five ingredients: (1) powdered amber, (2) a relic or symbol of the entity they wish to invoke, (3) three individuals standing in a circle to invoke the entity's name, (4) a crystal chime (which Exethanter can provide them), and (5) a location where the entity's spirit is strongest. If the powdered amber is placed in the center of the circle, and the chime sounded three times when the incantation is completed, interspersed with the entity's name being spoken aloud, the essence of the entity shall be summoned for ten minutes within the circle.

However, the phylactery belongs not to Exethanter, but the **arcanaloth** Neferon, as discussed in **Neferon's Phylactery** below. Neferon's phylactery can't be destroyed except:

> [!info]+ **Neferon's Phylactery**
> Upon his entry into the Mists, Neferon's life-force was split.
> 
> Although fiends ordinarily return to the Lower Planes upon their deaths, such resurrection is impossible for those trapped within the walls of the Mists, whose essences cannot escape to their home planes. As such, when a fiend enters the Mists, the Dark Powers split their being in two, dividing its essence and creating a phylactery unique to its being. When the fiend's body is slain within the Mists, its life-force immediately transfers to its phylactery, as described in **lich**. The fiend may remain in its phylactery for an unlimited time awaiting a new body.
>
> After resting for at least twenty-four hours, the fiend within the phylactery may search for a new physical form. Unlike a lich, the fiend must possess a living victim. The fiend may possess its chosen victim in the same way as a **ghost's** ***possession***. The fiend loses any physical abilities of its natural form, but retains its hit points, mental ability scores, and any spells known or spell-like abilities. If a fiend's phylactery is destroyed, the fiend dies permanently.
>
> Neferon's phylactery can be destroyed only by the strike of a *sun blade*, and otherwise has the AC and hit points described in RAW. 

> [!abstract]+ **Exethanter’s Inspection**
> If shown Neferon’s phylactery, Exethanter is surprised to see it, and asks to inspect it. “It appears to be reminiscent of a lich’s phylactery,” he observes, “though I do not detect Patrina’s handiwork upon it, nor sense her magic. Its essence is at once old, and yet new—as though it was created only recently, but from an old, even ancient soul—but something inhuman.” (Exethanter apologizes for his inability to share anything further without at least a day of further study.)
# S8. Departing the Temple
As the players move to depart the Amber Temple, Neferon confronts them as they pass through the West Gallery, East Gallery, or main temple floor. Neferon, flanked by the three **flameskulls** from the West Gallery, asks them to identify any physical items they have removed from the temple. "After all," he says, "as this temple's caretaker, I am obliged to ensure that no artifacts are improperly removed from its ancient halls."

If Neferon, through the use of his *arcane eye* spell, is aware of any particular items the players have removed from the temple (e.g., the *Sunsword*), he responds to players lying through a careful escalation. First, if the players deny possessing any such items, he kindly asks whether they are "certain" that they do not possess such a thing, reminding them (as the flameskulls drift menacingly behind him) that the Temple "does not take kindly to thieves." If the players again falsely deny possessing any such items, he innocently inquires about any items he is aware of by description, such as "a broken platinum sword hilt."

If the players again deny possessing any such items, Neferon shakes his head sadly, noting his sorrow that "one simply cannot trust people these days," and uses his ***teleport*** action to teleport into the head of the statue if possible, and out of the players' sight (e.g., into the Amber Halls if not). The **flameskulls** then attack.

If the players reveal any items they have taken, Neferon notes pleasantly that he would be more than happy to negotiate the terms that may allow the players to retain such items, so long as the players make full disclosure of the item's nature and value.

Neferon teleports away and directs the flameskulls to attack if he senses that they are concealing the nature or value of any of the items they have claimed. He is willing to allow the players to depart the Temple with any relic or magical item in exchange for a magical item of equal or greater value, or "a secret of great power." Neferon is fine with any secrets about Barovia so long as they're "powerful" ones.

Neferon is, however, unwilling to allow the players to depart with the *Sunsword* if he is aware of it, believing strongly that its value as insurance against Strahd in the future is too great a bargaining chip to let go. "You may depart in peace," Neferon notes solemnly, "but the item you have found, I fear, is too great a treasure for me to part with." Neferon doesn't do this if the players haven't yet performed the seance and reignited the Sunsword's radiant blade, or if the players otherwise successfully deceive him as to the nature of the Sunsword's hilt.

(See above for Neferon's combat tactics)

> [!abstract]+ **Neferon’s Phylactery**
> Neferon offers no resistance to players who credibly threaten to destroy his phylactery. In exchange for allowing them to depart in peace, however, he asks that they leave the phylactery somewhere safe where he can subsequently retrieve it. If the players refuse, Neferon “surrenders” to the players, notes his apparent inability to stop them, and allows them to depart in peace. (Unless prevented, Neferon subsequently uses his at-will *invisibility* and fly speed to follow the players as they depart the Amber Temple, following them until he finds a suitable opportunity to steal back his phylactery. When doing so, Neferon avoids fighting or confronting the players openly at all costs, preferring instead to use his *alter self*, *darkness*, *invisibility*, *detect thoughts*, *suggestion*, *dimension door*, and *hold monster* spells to infiltrate their sleeping location and recover his targets before fleeing. 

> [!info]+ **Converting the Flameskulls**
> The three **flameskulls** in the [[#West Gallery]] follow Neferon out of a belief that he is secretly Patrina Velikovna, transformed into a demonic form after many years away from the Temple, and disguising herself to avoid the wrath of her enemies. The players can induce the flameskulls to betray Neferon, or can induce the flameskulls to cease taking Neferon's orders by casting *dispel magic* (and thereby removing his disguise and revealing his true arcanaloth form), by inducing him to enter a *zone of truth* spell (if Neferon refuses, the flameskulls grow uncertain and wary, and encourage him to do so; if forced to step into the *zone of truth*, Neferon instead casts *dimension door* in an attempt to escape into [[#Phylactery Room]], where he retrieves his phylactery before casting *dimension door* again to teleport into the skies above the Amber Temple.

> [!abstract]+ **Neferon's Flight**
> If the players successfully gain access to the [[#Amber Vault]], Neferon casts *dimension door* to retrieve his phylactery from [[#Phylactery Room]] and return it to the head of his statue.

The Tyrant’s Third Trial
Strahd scries the players or Ireena to identify their current location. He can’t scry them if they’re in Soldav. If his scrying fails, he tries to find them with his spies as described above, and personally visits the Amber Temple to determine whether they’re there.

Once Strahd finds the players, he dismounts Beucephalus and greets them. He asks them where they disappeared to during their time in (unbeknownst to him) Soldav. He is very curious to know how they concealed themselves from him. If they refuse to disclose this, he assures them that he’ll find out, sooner or later.

Regardless, Strahd then looks toward his original victim (the one that was voted to be drained during the first trial) and demands that they submit themselves to be drained again. If the players respond by summoning the Roc of Mt. Ghakis using the charm that Elder Burebis gave them, the Roc arrives swiftly, within a minute or less. When it does, a great shadow blocks out the moonlight, and Strahd looks up, his eyes widening slightly. The roc, resembling a gargantuan raven as big as the Blue Water Inn, with a wingspan twice as long, leans down and shrieks at Strahd. Strahd’s face darkens, and he remarks that the players seem to have made interesting allies indeed. “I have no quarrel with you,” he remarks, glancing up at it, and warns it that open defiance of his orders to stand down may pose consequences in the future. “Are you sure you wish to play this game?” he asks. The roc lowers its gaze and nods, its eyes glowering. “As you wish,” Strahd says. He then whistles for Beucephalus, which appears beside him. “Another time, then,” he says, nodding toward the players, before vanishing. 

The Roc lingers until dawn, guarding the players’ resting place, then departs when they awaken. Once Strahd has departed, the Roc can confirm the following information using nods and shakes of its head. It is the Roc of Mount Ghakis; its true name is Turul; it is the familiar of the Seeker; its nest lies upon the peak of Mount Ghakis; it is no friend of Strahd’s; it previously appeared to the players in the form of a raven at Berez. (It will neither confirm nor deny whether it stole the third enchanted gem from the Wizard of Wines winery.)


Return to Soldav
When the players conclude their business at the Amber Temple, they may return to Soldav. The journey is easy and takes as long as it did on the way out. If three days have passed, Diona and Coryllus return with them; otherwise, the Mountain Folk remain at the Amber Temple to complete Diona’s rite of passage there.

If Strahd is unable to scry upon the players that night, he waits until the following morning while aloft on Beucephalus’s back in the skies above. Unless they conceal themselves somehow, he confronts them on the mountain road down Tsolenka Pass at the gatehouse bridge, or along the banks of the Luna River if the players fly down toward Berez instead. (The Mountain Folk can show the players a path that leads down from the mountain to the Luna River, as well as a longer path that leads back to the gatehouse bridge.)

When the players return to Soldav, Chief Diegia and her husband are eager for news of Diona’s health and that of her compatriots, and are saddened to learn of the deaths of Meda and Duras. “They knew the risks,” Diona’s father intones solemnly, “but their families will nonetheless mourn to have lost them.”

Diegia informs the players that Elder Burebis has fallen gravely ill, but that he has asked to see them immediately upon their return to Soldav. Scorilo and Como greet the players and lead them to Burebis’s cavern at the Shrine of the Rozana. Burebis, whose voice scarcely rises above a whisper, and whose flesh appears pallid and pale, tells the players that he is dying because Strahd has done something in response to the roc appearing and/or the players taking shelter. “Nevertheless, it is my time,” Burebis says, “if not far past it, for I have lingered long past my due upon this plane.”

Burebis asks the players if they have obtained a means to commune with the Ladies Three from the Amber Temple. If they have, he opens the way - a secret stone door - to the Cavern of Lights, the place where the Mountain Folk first communed with the spirits of the Rozana millenia ago. “That is where their spirits will be strongest,” he assures them. “If they will hear your call anywhere, they shall hear it there.”

The Cavern of Lights is a small, circular stone chamber perhaps twenty feet across. Its walls are marked by four symbols: the spider of the Weaver, the wolf of the Huntress, the raven of the Seeker, and the butterfly of the Dreamer. If asked about the butterfly, Burebis says only that it is a question he once asked his mentor, the Seeker, and that she declined to share it with him, instead noting that it was a story that has come to its end, and deserves its rest.

The chamber has crystals covering the walls and floor and ceiling. If the players carry out the amber summoning ritual, there is a sound like a woman’s breath exhaling, followed by a faint wind that stirs the dust. The amber shards at the center of the summoning circle glow with light, which beams and refracts through the crystals to create patterns of glimmering auroras across the walls of the Weaver and the Huntress. The auroras are the presences of the Weaver and Huntress, and can communicate through telepathic images and emotions and, occasionally, through words, though the effort is exhausting to the goddesses.

The Weaver and Huntress can share the following images and emotions: 

 * They can confirm that they’re the Weaver and Huntress, indicated by an image of a spider standing on a rock by a stream with a wolf curled protectively around it and a sense of assent.
* They can confirm that the Seeker is not present, indicated by an image of an empty raven’s tree with scattered feathers around it and a sense of longing.
* Regarding the butterfly, they communicate only a sense of grief and loss, a scene of a grave marked by fresh-fallen snow. (They refuse to elaborate.)
* They can confirm that the Seeker is not dead, and that she has gone elsewhere, indicated by images of an animal hiding, a caterpillar in a chrysalis, and some other image of a symbiote within another animal.
* They can confirm that Strahd has desecrated the Fanes, indicated by images of a dark, tall, gaunt shadow standing above three stones carved with the images of Spider, Wolf, and Raven, as he cuts his hand and lets blood run down to drown each of them.
* They can confirm that the way to restore the Fanes is to obtain three pinecone-shaped green gems that glow with light, one viridian, one emerald, and one sage. (viridian/weaver — #007F5C (a deeper, richer green with subtle blue undertones, more forest-floor primal) emerald/huntress — #50C878 (still the classic, vibrant green—bold and alive) sage/seeker — #77815C (earthier, a balanced green-gray that stays grounded in nature)). The gems must be buried within their respective places - the viridian gem at the standing stone amidst the swamp, the emerald gem at the standing stone atop the terraced hill surrounded by trees, and the sage gem at the standing stone at the foot of a mountain spur - indicated by the gems sinking into the earth and sprouting lush trees - pine (swamp), oak (forest), and rowan (mountain)
* They can relay, however, that the gems are dead and inactive, and that each gem must be given by silhouettes resembling the players (bowing and kneeling) to a trio of dark silhouettes, which will then kindle it to life and unique light before they can be brought and buried by that respective person. The silhouettes are two men and a woman. 
* The Ladies convey somehow that something must be done to rekindle them. Specifically: (1) the Weaver requires “unity” between the raven of the vines and the raven of the lake; (2) the Huntress requires “peace” between the monster hunter and the one hunted by monsters; and (3) the Seeker requires “faith” within “the reluctant servant of darkness, who sees no dawn, only eternal mists.” 
* The Ladies convey that two of the gems have been stolen, and that the third is held within the raven’s claws.

When the communion is done, the lights fade and the Ladies depart the cavern.


The Tyrant’s Fourth Trial

Shortly after dawn on the first day after the players depart the Amber Temple, at the first opportunity when he can find them, Strahd descends upon the players and confronts them. He informs them that (following Burebis’s death) he can now see the settlement of Soldav on the mountain within the crater, and that he would be most intrigued to speak to the “savages” there to learn whether the players have sheltered there. “Given that I seem to have been unable to detect you during your time there,” he says, “I am sure it would be a most *riveting* conversation.”

Strahd informs the players that he has come to finalize his draining and turning of the chosen player, and demands that they step forward to be handed over. If they do, he drains them, then takes the body atop Beucephalus and departs.

If they refuse, he threatens to kill them. If they pull out the Sunsword and ignite it, he steps back, eyes widening, looking surprised (though, before they ignite the blade, he first notes that “that old relic” cannot possibly wound him, adding that he has “long wondered what Khazan’s fool of an apprentice did with it”). 

Once the Sunsword is ignited, Strahd regains his composure and congratulates them on repairing “Sergei’s old toy.” “My father’s, to begin with, of course,” he adds. “My congratulations on finding your backbone; if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that the weak always find their strength in their toys.”

“Nevertheless, you seem to have caught me at an inopportune moment,” Strahd concludes. “I must applaud your temerity - but note, of course, that this changes nothing between us. Each day of defiance only worsens the consequences for those around you - and the inevitable pain that you bring upon yourselves.”

His skin beginning to curl and scorch and peel, he shares a brief nod, steps beside Beucephalus, and wishes “Good day” - and is gone.
