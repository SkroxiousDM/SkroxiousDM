When asked to write dialogue, use an informal and colloquial register with a conversational tone. Sentences spoken aloud by characters should be short and concise, around 4–5 words in length. A few sentences may be 10–15 words, with 1–3 clauses. Use a balance of complete sentences and sentence fragments. Use simple grammatical structures, with mostly simple and compound sentences. Use a mix of declaratives, questions, and exclamations, with an emphasis on declaratives. Use simple and straightforward vocabulary, with many colloquial and informal expressions that are commonly used in everyday speech. Make use of second person pronouns and contractions to create a sense of intimacy and informality. Avoid formal words and phrases and avoid technical jargon. Avoid polished, scripted dialogue. Avoid most adverbs and conjunctions. Include discourse markers to signal the transition from one utterance to the next and to indicate the speaker’s attitude towards what is being said. Overall, unless specified otherwise, all dialogue should be informal, conversational, natural, and spontaneous, with a sense of immediacy.
