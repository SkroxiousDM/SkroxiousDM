... the 2nd floor parlor... had large mirrors. One of my players (eldest daughter) used magic to disguise her self as Rose because something fell off. The other player found a dog cowering in the house itself. They left to approach Rose and Thorn about the dog, with it in hand. The rest stayed upstairs. As my daughter investigated the room I said, "You watch as the other 2 members are exploring the rest of the room as well, your attenion on the mirror you are walking besides. Your hand touching the smooth surface. What catches your attention is you see the other two no longer walking around. They are sitting at the instruments, their faces drawn, emotionless, as their eyes look straight into yours. You turn to look back, and you see them still moving around the room like they were moments before. You look back at the mirror and notice  something. Your own reflection...is not there. You look back along the mirror and see your reflection about 3 paces back has stopped moving and just stares at you. But what you see, is your true reflection. A smile creeps upon your reflected image, as the door is seen thrown open. A dozen undead creatures come running into the room, your images stay there looking at you as you watch each of them get torn into and dragged from the room. You turn around.... nothing. Door is closed. Your party mates are looking at you perplexed. You turn back... staring back at you... into your own eyes... is your reflection. As it should be. In disguise.
