<p>The murmurs from the next room are largely indistinct, obscured by the low groans of the old house's timbers. As you strain your ears, however, the siblings' words come slowly into focus.</p>
<p>Ireena's voice, sharp with indignation, pierces the silence. "You had no right, Ismark. You can't just decide to send me away, like I'm some kind of inconvenience! I'm Father's child as much as you, and our people need me to rebuild. You need me too!"</p>
<p>Ismark's reply is measured, though laced with an unmistakable note of worry. "The Devil still has his sights set on you—and even if we don't believe the legend about women with red hair, others might. Barovia just isn't safe for you anymore."</p>
<p>A snort of defiance echoes from the other side of the thin wooden partition. "I am no coward, Ismark, and I will not abandon our friends and neighbors in their hour of need."</p>
<p>There's a pause. Then, Ismark says, quietly, "Gertruda is gone."</p>
<p>You hear a choked sob from Ireena's direction. "No."</p>
<p>"She must have gone after Doru," Ismark murmurs. "I told her to give up on him—to accept that he must simply be dead—but I don't think she ever could."</p>
<p>There's a long, suffering silence. Then—</p>
<p>Ismark seems to hesitate, his words slightly fumbled. "I'm not asking you to abandon them. But there are others who need your help. Think about our neighbors who fled for Vallaki. They need guidance, advocacy—and perhaps a leader to bring them home one day."</p>
<p>There is a long pause, filled only with the muffled sounds of low, haggard breaths. Ireena's voice is low when she finally speaks—barely even audible. "I still don't like it."</p>
<p>Ismark's response is quiet. "It's your choice. I can't take that away from you. But after losing Father, I can't... I can't bear the thought of losing you too."</p>
<p>The silence that follows is palpable, weighted with unspoken emotions. Finally, Ireena's voice breaks it, fragile and quiet. "I will go. If only for you. And only if we bury Father first—together."</p>


> If the players ask about Doru's rebellion, Ireena can share the following information:
> 
> * Doru was a friend of theirs, and the son of the village priest Father Donavich. He was a bright and cheery young man, with a sunny disposition and a zeal for everything he did.
> * Just over three months ago, without warning, Doru announced a crusade against Castle Ravenloft, which he proclaimed would free Barovia from the mists and return sunlight to the valley. Over two dozen young Barovians accompanied him, as well as a scholar from distant lands named Alanik Ray, who had been staying as a guest at Ismark and Ireena's home for the previous several weeks while studying Barovian history and ecology.

> * Ireena doesn't recall much about Alanik, other than that he was a curious, somewhat intense man who kept to himself, took long walks into the Svalich Woods, and owned a pet monkey. She does remember, however, that he had a furious argument with Doru at one point, which confused her when he accompanied Doru to Castle Ravenloft shortly thereafter.
