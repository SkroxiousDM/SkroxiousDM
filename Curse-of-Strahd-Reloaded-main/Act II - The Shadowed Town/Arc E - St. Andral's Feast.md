_An adventure for five 4th-level characters._

In this arc, the players escort Ireena Kolyana to St. Andral's Church in Vallaki, fulfilling their vow to her brother, Ismark. However, Father Lucian, the church's priest, informs them that the bones of Saint Andral—the source of the church's protective magic—have recently been stolen, placing its wards and parishioners at risk.

The players have until the night of their fourth day after arriving in Vallaki to identify the thief (the church groundskeeper, Milivoj), track down the bones to their hiding place (the Vallaki coffin maker's shop), and return them to their rightful place in the church. Their mission will bring them into direct conflict with Volenta Popofsky, Strahd's most sadistic vampiric bride, and her vampiric minions.

Can the players defeat Volenta's plan and restore the church's protection? Or will the church be lost in darkness and blood, its flickering light snuffed out in the shadows?
# E1. St. Andral's Church
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Chapter 5: Area N1.</em></span>

The church is largely as described in <span class="citation">N1. St. Andral's Church (p. 97)</span>. Milivoj, the church groundskeeper, isn’t present when the players arrive.

The church's occupants follow the following schedule unless interrupted:

* At dawn, Yeska joins Father Lucian for prayers in the chapel and assists him in preparing breakfast.
* In the morning, Yeska runs errands  around Vallaki while Father Lucian sweeps the chapel, dusts the pews, polishes the altar, and tidies up the kitchen.
* In the afternoon, Father Lucian teaches Yeska how to read, and educates him in basic history and theology.
* In the evening, with Yeska's assistance, Father Lucian leads the congregation in prayer and delivers a sermon promising sanctuary and comfort.

> ***Resonance.*** Father Petrovich should inspire gratitude with his hospitality, flattery with his willingness to listen and empathize, comfort with his warmth, serenity, and wisdom, and sympathy for his anxiety regarding the missing bones and the safety of his congregation.
>
> ***Emotions.*** Father Petrovich’s most frequent emotions are thoughtfulness, hopefulness, concern, and compassion.
>
> ***Motivations.*** Father Petrovich wants to keep Vallaki's spirits up, to keep the church a place of sanctuary and comfort, and to raise Yeska as best as he can.
>
> ***Inspirations.*** When playing Father Petrovich, channel Uncle Iroh (*Avatar: The Last Airbender*), Michael Carpenter and Father Forthill (*The Dresden Files*), and Mr. Rogers (*Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood*).
>
> **Character Information**
>
> ***Persona.*** To strangers, Father Petrovich is a serene, humble, and compassionate priest who is always happy to share a word of praise or a few pearls of wisdom. To those he trusts, Father Petrovich is a dedicated and stalwart defender of his community, who nonetheless worries about his ability to keep his congregants safe. Deep down, Father Petrovich harbors a twinge of doubt about the Morninglord's providence and power, wondering if Strahd's awakening is a test of Barovians' faith or a sign that the land is forsaken forever.
>
> ***Morale.*** In a fight, Father Petrovich would prefer to dissuade his attackers, surrendering peacefully if necessary to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. However, if an innocent life or the members of his congregation were threatened, he would fight to the death with a prayer on his lips and peace in his heart.
>
> ***Relationships.*** Father Petrovich is a mentor and father figure to the orphan and altar boy Yeska, the employer of the groundskeeper Milivoj, the brother of Baroness Lydia Petrovna, and the distant descendant of Tasha Petrovna, an ancient cleric of the Morninglord whose remains are kept in the catacombs of Castle Ravenloft.
## E1a. Meeting Father Lucian
When the players first meet [[Non-Player Characters#Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Petrovich]], he greets them warmly, recognizing them as newcomers to Vallaki, welcoming them to St. Andral's Church, and asking if they have come seeking fellowship or to pray to the Morninglord.

If informed that Ireena is seeking sanctuary in the church from Strahd or other monsters, Father Petrovich first ensures that no other congregants are present—shooing away Yeska if present—and swears the players to secrecy.

If the players agree not to spread his words beyond the church, Father Petrovich sorrowfully informs them that, while he would love nothing more than to extend Ireena an offer of permanent shelter, recent events have left the church's wards in a precarious state. He can also share the following additional information at the players' prompting:

* The church is ordinarily hallowed ground, as though the building was protected by a *hallow* spell. This magical ward prevents fiends and undead from entering the church, and keeps them from magically charming, frightening, or possessing those within it.
* The source of this protection is the crypt of Saint Andral, which has historically held the blessed bones of Andral himself, the founder of Vallaki's church and a great cleric of the Morninglord.
* Originally, only Father Petrovich knew of the bones' existence. However, after news the siege of Barovia reached Vallaki a few days ago, he shared the knowledge of the bones with Yeska, as described in <span class="citation">Bones of St. Andral (p. 97)</span>.
* To retain the church's protection, Father Petrovich must invoke a particular rite of protection over Saint Andral's bones once every year, at dawn on the morning of Saint Andral's Feast—a holy day that memorializes Andral's life. 
* If the rite cannot be carried out at that time, the wards will fall until the rite is completed on a subsequent dawn.
* Last night, someone broke into the church's crypt and stole St. Andral's bones. Without them, Father Petrovich can't complete the protective rite, and the wards will fall at dawn on the day of St. Andral's Feast. 
* Father Petrovich is fearful that some fell creature or wicked soul has manufactured this crisis as an opportunity to cause his congregation harm; though the Baron is confident that no monsters could breach Vallaki's walls, Father Petrovich fears that the town is not as safe as it appears.

Father Petrovich can also share the date of St. Andral's Feast, which will take place on the fourth day after the players arrived in Vallaki. He has not reported the theft of the bones for the reasons described in <span class="citation">Bones of St. Andral (p. 97)</span>.

Father Petrovich does not know that Yeska has told anyone of the bones' existence, and firmly believes that the boy would not be capable—physically or otherwise—of stealing them. He does not suspect Milivoj of stealing the bones either, having no reason to do so.

If the players express an interest in doing so, Father Petrovich is glad to allow them to inspect the crime scene—having made neither heads nor tails of it himself—and to interview Yeska, so long as they promise to be patient and gentle with the boy. 

If the players ask for the identities of other possible witnesses, Father Petrovich notes that the only other employee of the church is the groundskeeper, Milivoj. However, Milivoj hasn’t come into work today. Father Petrovich can give the players directions to Milivoj’s house, which is located in the northwestern quarter of Vallaki.

Before allowing the players to begin their investigation, Father Petrovich asks them to promise to retrieve him as soon as they learn of the bones' location. He takes personal responsibility for their disappearance, and—given his connections across the town and his service to the Morninglord—wishes to assist the players in recovering them if necessary.
## E1b. The Scene of the Crime
[[Non-Player Characters#Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Petrovich]] is glad to lead the players to the location of the crypt if prompted. The players can inspect the replaced floorboards behind the altar for clues, and Father Lucian will also reluctantly allow them to pry up the floorboards again if they want to investigate the crypt itself.

The crypt is as described in <span class="citation">Bones of St. Andral (p. 97)</span>, lying beneath the chapel's altar and concealed by the chapel floorboards. The interior of the crypt is a dark and damp chamber, its walls made of rough-hewn stone blocks that are stained with age and moisture. Its center contains a small stone slab, which held the bones until recently.

The players can find the following information by investigating the area around the crypt:

* While investigating the floorboards, the players can find a torn piece of gray wool fabric snagged on a nail with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, and a line of rust-stained dirt smeared across a floorboard with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. 
* While investigating the interior of the crypt, the players can find several clumps of earth with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. Each clump is in the shape of a large bootprint, and contains several blades of pale green grass and white flower petals. 

* While investigating the altar or the stone slab in the crypt, the players can find a few strands of dark black hair with a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. 

The fabric was torn from Milivoj's shirt as he lowered himself down, and the rust was left when he used his shovel to pry up the floorboards.

The clumps of earth were left when Milivoj's boots hit the floor of the crypt. Father Lucian can inform the players that the petals are from the ramson plant, which grow in several patches in the church graveyard.

The hair is Milivoj's.
## E1c. Interviewing Yeska
If the players choose to interview Yeska, [[Non-Player Characters#Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Petrovich]] asks them not to press him too hard for information. The boy is still emotionally fragile from the death of his parents three months ago, and Father Lucian doesn't wish to harm his mental well-being over a mere suspicion of danger.

If one of the players asks Yeska whether he has told anyone else about the bones and makes a successful DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check, he admits to telling Milivoj about the bones three days ago. If the players first tell Yeska that the bones have been stolen, however, the DC increases to 15, and Yeska begins to cry upon admitting his actions.
# E2. Milivoj’s House
Milivoj’s house is located in the impoverished northwest quarter of Vallaki, a short walk from St. Andral’s Church. 

<div class="description">
<p>The muddy road that leads into the town’s northwest quarter is rough and uneven, chilled by a persistent fog that seems to cling to the soaked earth beneath your feet. As you move further from the town’s center, the streets narrow and the houses grow grimier and more dilapidated, the smell of damp wood and mildew filling your nostrils.</p>
<p>Your path leads you to a leaning, decrepit structure that seems to sag beneath its own weight. Its timbers are rotting, the windows cracked and filthy. At its front, a ramshackle wooden door stands slightly askew in its frame atop a small, mud-spattered porch.</p>
</div>

If the players knock on the door, it’s answered a few moments thereafter by Jarzinka, Milivoj’s mother. Read:

<div class="description">
<p>The door groans open, revealing a gaunt, glassy-eyed woman standing on the other side. Her hair is matted with grease and hangs in knots across her shoulders, and a painted beaded necklace hangs around her neck, its colors faded and chipped with age.</p>
<p>Behind her, a trio of young children wrestle and shout as they roll across a cramped living space stuffed with old, threadbare furniture and an old, stained rug. Two other children—a near-adolescent boy with long, shaggy hair, and a freckled girl of similar age wearing cracked, oversized glasses—peer curiously around a pair of overstuffed, patchwork armchairs at the sight of you.</p>
<p>The woman at the door grunts, her hollow gaze scanning you expectantly.</p>
</div>

The children in the armchairs are a twelve-year-old boy named Bogan and a ten-year-old girl named Zondra. The three children wrestling on the ground are named Lazlo (eight years old), Grilsha (seven years old), and Dargos (five years old).

Jarzinka is a woman of few words, and is annoyed because she has just finished the last of her dream pastries. If the players ask to speak with Milivoj, she turns to Bogan and Zondra, then grunts at them. The conversation then proceeds as follows:

* Bogan cheerfully informs the players that Milivoj is sick and doesn’t want to talk to anyone today.
* If the players succeed on a DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check or insist that the matter is urgent, Zondra turns and hollers, “Milo! Someone wants to speak to you.”

A few moments later, [[Non-Player Characters#Milivoj|Milivoj]] exits a swollen wooden door at the back of the room, with his three-year-old brother Jirko giggling delightedly from atop Milivoj’s shoulders and his four-year-old twin sisters, Victoria and Vasha, hanging from his biceps.

> [!profile]+ **Profile: Milivoj**
>
> **Roleplaying Information**
> ***Resonance.*** Milivoj should inspire scorn with his gruff, cynical, and stubborn personality, sympathy for his frustration at his parents' addiction to dream pastries, and endearment to him for his wholehearted dedication to provide for his siblings, no matter the cost to himself.
>
> ***Emotions.*** Milivoj's most frequent emotions are annoyance, worry, frustration, boredom, bitterness, and cynicism, and (when with his siblings) compassion, mirth, and joy.
>
> ***Motivations.*** Milivoj wants to provide for himself and his siblings.
>
> ***Inspirations.*** When playing Milivoj, channel Katniss Everdeen (*The Hunger Games*), Arya Stark (*Game of Thrones*), and Carl Fredericksen (*Up*).
>
> **Character Information**
> ***Persona.*** To strangers, Milivoj is a quiet, gruff, and hardworking groundskeeper. To those he trusts, Milivoj is a loving and dedicated elder sibling, a frustrated and bitter son, and a desperate and confused young man.
>
> ***Morale.*** In a fight, Milivoj would brandish his shovel in an attempt to get his attacker to back down, but would quickly surrender if seriously wounded. (If defending his siblings, however, Milivoj would fiercely and gladly fight to the death.)
>
> ***Relationships.*** Milivoj is employed by Father Lucian Petrovich, secretly works for the coffin maker Henrik van der Voort, and is the eldest of nine children belonging to Oleg and Jarzinka, two dream pastry-addicted Vallakians.

Upon spotting the players, Milivoj’s face visibly falls, and he gently shakes Victoria and Vasha from his arms and sets Jirko down in Bogan’s lap. A successful DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals his body language has grown tense, and that he is shifting uncomfortably. 

As Milivoj reaches the door, he tersely addresses Jarzinka as “Mother” and gives her a grudging nod. Jarzinka grunts and shuffles away from the door, disappearing into the room from which Milivoj came.

If the players inform Milivoj that they want to speak with him about St. Andral’s bones, he scowls, insists that he knows nothing about the matter, and attempts to close the door. A player can prevent him from doing so with a successful DC 10 Strength or Dexterity check. (If Milivoj successfully closes the door, the players can make him open it again by making a sufficient nuisance of themselves, by succeeding on a DC 10 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check, or by forcing the door down with a successful DC 10 Strength check.)

Milivoj denies any knowledge of the bones or their theft if asked about them outright. However, he claims to have seen a cloaked figure watching the church two days ago from an alleyway. (The description of the cloaked figure coincidentally matches the appearance of Ernst Larnak, Fiona's spy, though Milivoj doesn't know Ernst or the nature of his employment.) A successful DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals that he is speaking slightly too quickly.

If the players accuse Milivoj of stealing the bones and succeed on a DC 15 Charisma (Intimidation) check, Milivoj admits to stealing them, as described in <span class="citation">Bones of St. Andral (p. 97)</span>. Players who confront Milivoj with evidence from the crypt or Yeska's confession automatically succeed. Milivoj can't take the players to the coffin maker's shop himself, but notes that Father Petrovich can lead them there.

If asked his motive for stealing the bones, Milivoj shares the reasons described in <span class="citation">Bones of St. Andral (p. 97)</span>. He can also share that, after his father—a former Vallakian guard—was  wounded in a recent wolf attack, both of his parents began regularly purchasing dream pastries from the peddler Morgantha outside of the gates. With both parents addicted to Morgantha's wares, Milivoj sees himself as his siblings' sole means of avoiding total poverty. (If asked, Milivoj can provide a basic description of the effects of dream pastries, as described in <span class="citation">Dream Pastries (p. 125)</span>.)

If informed that the bones may have been stolen to allow an attack upon the church, Milivoj dismisses the idea, insisting that the bones are just a "moldy old relic" and that "he doesn't have time to believe in fairy tales." 

> [!abstract]+ **Milivoj’s Revelation**
>
> If he is later informed that Henrik's actions were directed by one of Strahd's vampire spawn, and that the theft of the bones could have allowed a slaughter at the church, [[Non-Player Characters#Milivoj|Milivoj]] is overcome with anxiety, horror, and guilt. He prostrates himself before Father Petrovich and begs for his forgiveness, offering to exile himself to the Svalich Woods if doing so will make up for the harm he has caused. (Father Petrovich, of course, declines, tearfully embracing and forgiving Milivoj instead.)

# E3. Return to the Church
Once Milivoj has admitted to the bones' theft, [[Non-Player Characters#Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Petrovich]] can lead the players to the coffin maker's shop. (He knows the owner, Henrik, well, and hopes that he can reason with the man.) If the players appear skeptical, Father Petrovich—who has the statistics of a **priest**—reveals that he bears the holy symbol of Tasha Petrovna—his ancestor and a mighty follower of Saint Markovia—and promises them that he is more than capable of defending himself.

If the players suggest reporting the theft of the bones to the burgomaster, Father Petrovich is reluctant to do so, fearing the possibility of raising a panic. With a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check, however, the players can convince Father Lucian to join them in reporting the theft to Baron Vallakovich, who responds as described in **N6. Coffin Maker's Shop.** (If the players don't have Father Petrovic with them, the burgomaster refuses to believe that the bones are responsible for the church's divine protection or to assist the players in recovering them.)

> [!abstract]+ **Reporting the Theft**
>
> If the players report the theft to Baron Vallakovich and do not accompany his guards, the four guards gain access to the coffin maker's shop as described in **N6. Coffin Maker's Shop**, but are slaughtered when they accidentally trigger Volenta's trap and alert the vampires to their presence.
>
> One day later, Baron Vallakovich responds by sending Izek to summon the players to **N3. Burgomaster's Mansion**, where he accuses them of causing his faithful guards to disappear and threatens to exile them from Vallaki. (The players can win back his good graces by promising to recover the bones themselves.)

# E4. Arasek Stockyard
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Chapter 5: Area N5.</em></span>

Arasek Stockyard is largely as described in <span class="citation">N5. Arasek Stockyard (p. 115)</span>. However, while Rictavio's wagon is mostly covered by old and faded paint, the Carnival of Wonders sign on its side is brand new and fresh-painted.

If one of the players expresses an interest in breaking into the wagon, [[Non-Player Characters#Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Petrovich]] discourages them from doing so if he is present.

If a player nonetheless attempts to unlock or force open the door to the wagon, the entire wagon suddenly rocks violently from side to side. The players can also hear the sound of something with large, heavy claws scratching against the interior of the wagon. (The rocking and scratches are made by the ghost of Erasmus van Richten, a **poltergeist** seeking to protect Arabelle by scaring visitors away.)

If the players successfully break the door to the wagon or pick its padlock, they find that the wagon’s interior contains a soft bed of straw, a comfortable woolen blanket, a few books, and a young Vistana girl—Arabelle—who is clutching a plush saber-toothed tiger to her chest and wearing a beaded necklace with a carved copper amulet. (For more information about Arabelle, see [[Arc F - The Missing Vistana]].)
# E4. Coffin Maker's Shop
<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Chapter 5: Area N6.</em></span>

The coffin maker's shop is largely as described in <span class="citation">N6. Coffin Maker's Shop (p. 116)</span>. However, the crates in **N6f. Vampire Nest** now contain only two **vampire spawn**, as well as **Volenta Popofsky**, one of Strahd's vampiric brides.

Henrik van der Voort, the coffin maker, follows the following schedule:

* In the morning, he sleeps in, remaining in bed in **N6e. Henrik's Bedroom**.
* In the late morning, he anxiously checks that the wardrobe containing St. Andral's bones hasn't been disturbed, and then prepares breakfast in **N6d. Kitchen**.
* In the afternoon, he builds coffins in **N6c. Workshop**.
* In the evening, he prepares an evening meal in **N6d. Kitchen**.
* At night, he sleeps in **N6e. Henrik's Bedroom.**
## E4a. Entering the Shop
The players cannot access the shop through persuasion, deception, or intimidation; in each case, Henrik will respond as described in **N6. Coffin Maker's Shop**. 

Additionally, note that the windows are locked from the inside and the doors are barred. As such, the players cannot open a window or door by use of *thieves tools*. Instead, the players can enter the shop by either of the following means:

* They can break down one or both of the barred doors with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. Doing so alerts Henrik, who comes to confront them.
* They can use magic (e.g., *mage hand* or *misty step*) to open the windows or doors from the inside. Doing so avoids alerting Henrik, who remains in his current location.

In either case, Henrik offers no resistance as soon as he sees that the players have entered the shop. Instead, he rightfully guesses that they have come to recover the bones and informs them of the bones' location and the danger of the vampire nest, as described in **N6. Coffin Maker's Shop**. In exchange, he pleads with them to protect him from the vampires, who he rightfully fears will butcher him for his betrayal. He won't retrieve the bones alone, but will accompany the players upstairs if demanded.

Henrik does not know that Volenta has secretly installed a poison needle trap and tripwire bell in the wardrobe secret compartment where the bones are kept. He assumes that the players will be able to quietly recover the bones, depart the shop, and escort him elsewhere to safety.
## E4b. Recovering the Bones
The bones have been concealed as described in <span class="citation">N6e. Henrik's Bedroom (p. 117)</span>. However, Volenta Popofsky has added two additional safeguards to the secret compartment:

* a **poison needle** trap (<span class="citation">Dungeon Master's Guide, p. 123</span>), which triggers unless a particular wooden panel is pushed before the compartment is opened, and
* a hidden wire attached to the compartment's opening, which connects to a noisemaker at the base of the compartment shaped vaguely like the head of the toymaker Gadof Blinsky, including his jester’s cap and bells. 

The poison needle trap can be identified and disarmed as described in the <span class="citation">Dungeon Master's Guide (p. 123)</span>. 

The hidden wire can be identified before the compartment is fully opened with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check, and disarmed with a successful DC 20 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check.

Opening the compartment without disabling the wire or unsuccessfully attempting to disarm the wire causes the noisemaker to loudly screech, “Is no fun, is no Blinsky!” repeatedly for 1 minute, alerting the vampires in **N6f. Vampire Nest**.
## E4c. Volenta's Trap
If the players allow the bell to ring, [[Non-Player Characters#Volenta Popofsky|Volenta]] and her two loyal **vampire spawn** arise to confront them one round later, either by forcing their way into **N6d. Kitchen** or (if the players have already exited **N6e. Henrik's Bedroom**) by obstructing the players' path down the stairs. When the vampires appear, they use their ***spider climb*** to clamber across the walls before dropping down to the players’ level, with Volenta crouching upside-down on the ceiling behind them.
![[Volenta Popofsky.png]]
> [!profile]+ **Profile: Volenta Popofsky**
>
> **Roleplaying Information**
> ***Resonance.*** Volenta should inspire revulsion with her obsession with pain and gore, discomfort with her sadistic and psychotic personality, and a strange sort of flattery with her flirtatious—if eccentric—attitude.
>
> ***Emotions.*** Volenta most often feels amused, curious, irritated, bored, fascinated, enraged, and gleeful.
>
> ***Motivations.*** Volenta wants to impress Strahd and earn her place as foremost among his brides, to satisfy her frequent sadistic urges, and to find novel ways to cause suffering and pain through tinkering and innovation.
>
> ***Inspirations.*** When playing Volenta, channel Jinx (*Arcane*), Ty Lee (*Avatar: The Last Airbender*), and Harley Quinn (*Batman*).
>
> **Character Information**
>
> ***Persona.*** To strangers, Volenta is a manic, impulsive, and trigger-happy sadist with a flair for invention and innovation.
>
> ***Morale.*** In a fight, Volenta would gleefully relish the opportunity to test her custom-made weapons on hostile subjects—and, when pushed far enough, to tear those subjects apart with her bare hands and teeth.
>
> ***Relationships.*** Volenta is fanatically loyal to Strahd von Zarovich, and views his other brides and consorts—especially Anastrasya, Ludmilla, and Escher—with deep resentment, jealousy, and suspicion.

Volenta uses the two vampire spawn with her as cover, placing them between her and the players. After briefly taunting the players, she playfully notes that it's lucky that they're in a coffin shop, adding, "After all, they'll need *somewhere* to put your parts when I'm through with you." She then directs the other vampires to attack.

If Volenta takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of the vampire's next turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spider Climb.</em></strong> Volenta can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sunlight Hypersensitivity.</em></strong> While in sunlight, Volenta takes 20 radiant damage at the start of her turn, and she has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Blood Frenzy.</em></strong> Volenta has advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that doesn't have all its hit points.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> Volenta makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by Volenta, incapacitated, or restrained. <em>Hit:</em> 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and Volenta regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.</p>
<p><strong><em>Claws.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage. Instead of dealing damage, Volenta can grapple the target (escape DC 13).</p>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Leap.</em></strong> Volenta moves up to her speed without provoking opportunity attacks. As she does, she can replace 10 feet of movement with a 10-foot high jump.</p>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Spit Blood.</em></strong> In response to taking damage from a melee attack, Volenta spits a wad of blood at the attacking creature’s eyes, forcing it to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature is blinded until the end of its next turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Aggress.</em></strong> In response to taking damage from an attack or spell, Volenta moves up to her speed toward a hostile creature she can see without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>

### 1. Volenta
[[Non-Player Characters#Volenta Popofsky|Volenta]] begins combat in her **first form**, preferring to start the fight by lobbing her ***alchemist's firebomb.*** Afterward, she alternates between using her ***multiattack*** to use ***tanglefoot*** and ***thunderstone***.

When using her ***hail of daggers***, Volenta prefers to target the players instead of Father Petrovich. As she fights them, she taunts Father Lucian gleefully, noting, "I'd intended to rip out your throat in front of your cute little congregation, but I guess decorating the church steps with your friends' heads and entrails isn't a bad second place!"

Volenta flees from combat, smashing through a nearby window and galloping across the rooftops like a four-legged beast, if either of the following happens:

* both of her vampire spawn are defeated and her first form is reduced to 0 hit points; or
* her second form is reduced to 50 hit points or fewer.

In either case she first snarls, “You think your precious little church can keep you safe? He'll burn down the rest of Vallaki to get to you, and kill the rest of this stinking vermin to force you out!” Before departing, she sneers at the players and promises to see them again soon.
### 2. Father Petrovich
[[Non-Player Characters#Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Petrovich]] retains the statistics of a **priest**. However, his ***divine eminence*** feature now reads as follows:

* ***Divine Eminence.*** As a reaction when he sees another creature within 30 feet hit with a weapon attack, Father Petrovich can expend a spell slot to cause that attack to magically deal an extra 10 (3d6) radiant damage to a target on a hit. If Father Petrovich expends a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d6 for each level above 1st.

In combat, Father Petrovich directs the players to form a defensive line around the door, hoping to funnel the vampires one-by-one into a choke point in order to dispatch them individually. Father Petrovich himself attempts to end his turns behind full cover on each round of combat, ducking out only briefly to target vampires with his offensive spells.

On his first turn, Father Petrovich uses his action to cast *spirit guardians*, filling the air with a galaxy of swirling, fiery suns that burn with fierce golden light. He stands as near to the front lines as possible while remaining behind full cover, seeking to ensure that any attacking vampire spawn will inevitably be drawn into range of his spell.

On his second turn, Father Petrovich casts *spiritual weapon*, summoning and attacking with a golden ethereal mace whose head resembles a sunburst—a facsimile of the mace that his ancestor, Tasha Petrovna, once wielded in battle. He then casts *sacred flame*, targeting any vampire that is currently attacking the players.

On his third and subsequent turns, Father Petrovich uses his action to cast *guiding bolt* and his bonus action to attack with *spiritual weapon* once again.

If any of the players are reduced to 0 hit points, Father Petrovich spends his action casting *cure wounds* on them. If his concentration is ever disrupted, he spends his action to renew *spirit guardians* instead.

> [!info]+ **Dying NPCs**
>
> Because Volenta and her **vampire spawn** prefer to target the players instead of Father Petrovich, it's unlikely that Father Petrovich will be reduced to 0 hit points in this battle.
>
> However, as noted in **Monsters and Death** (<span class="citation">Player's Handbook, p. 198</span>), allied non-player characters—such as Father Petrovich, Ireena Kolyana, and any other NPC fighting alongside the players—should fall unconscious upon being reduced to 0 hit points. When they do, they follow the same rules for death saving throws as player characters, described further in **Death Saving Throws** (<span class="citation">Player's Handbook, p. 197</span>).
### 3. The Vampire Spawn
The two **vampire spawn** fight by using their ***claws*** to grapple enemies, who they then drag away to feast upon in private—preferably by hauling grappled prey out of the windows and onto the rooftop of the shop. Both spawn are prepared to fight to the death, but retreat with Volenta if she does.
# E5. Retrieving the Bones
If the players and Father Lucian successfully return the stolen bones to St. Andral’s Church by dawn of the fifth day after the players arrived in Vallaki, Father Lucian thanks the players and invites Ireena to remain under their protection for as long as she desires. Volenta’s attack is averted, and the celebration of St. Andral’s Feast begins without a hitch.

**_Milestone_**. Restoring the bones of St. Andral completes a story milestone. If the church is successfully reconsecrated, award each player 1,250 XP. 

> [!abstract]+ **A Peaceful Recovery**
>
> If the players recover the bones of St. Andral without alerting or defeating Volenta and her **vampire spawn**, Volenta is enraged by Henrik’s failure to stop them and humiliated by her plan’s failure. That same night, she uses her **_alchemist’s firebomb_** to burn down the shop, causing a fire that also damages two nearby warehouses before it’s extinguished.
>
> If Henrik still dwells within the shop, Volenta spirits him away to Castle Ravenloft. There, she locks him in a cage in **K76. Torture Chamber** and visits painful torments upon him each night as punishment for his betrayal.

# Design Notes: St. Andral's Feast
***St. Andral's Church.*** The original module's requirement that one of the players be a cleric or paladin to receive this quest has been removed to make it more accessible. 

Though it doesn't exist in the original adventure, the holy day of St. Andral's Feast has been added to provide a clear deadline for the players' efforts to recover the bones, and to ensure a safe place for Ireena to stay while the arc unfolds.

The date of the bones' theft has been moved to the night of the players' arrival in Vallaki to ensure that the scene of the crime is sufficiently undisturbed for the players to do substantive detective work while investigating. An assortment of clues has been added to clearly point the finger at Milivoj.

Milivoj himself has been relocated to his family home—both to show (not tell) his motivation for stealing the bones, to provide dramatic distance between the players' investigation and their confrontation with its prime witness, and to accentuate the appearance of Milivoj's guilty conscience.

***Return to the Church.*** Father Petrovich asks to accompany the players to the coffin maker's shop in order to ensure that the party has the benefits of his *spirit guardians* spell during the fight with Volenta's **vampire spawn** (i.e., to counteract their regeneration).

***Arasek Stockyard.*** Erasmus's ghost has been added to discourage the players from investigating the wagon while also carefully avoiding *encouraging* them to do it out of spite.

The fresh paint for the Carnival of Wonders sign has been added to intentionally foreshadow that Rictavio (who the players will confront in [[Arc F - The Missing Vistana]]) is not all that he seems.

***Coffin Maker's Shop.*** Volenta's two traps have been added to increase the probability that the players do battle with the vampires, thereby introducing them directly to Strahd's minions and the threat posed by vampires. The number of **vampire spawn** has been reduced from six to three, including Volenta, to ensure that the encounter is balanced for a 4th-level party.

Volenta has been placed as the mastermind of this scheme in order to provide the players with a low-level boss that they can reasonably defeat—but who will recur as an antagonist throughout the adventure.

Volenta's statblock has been designed to provide the players with a dynamic, tactical experience while ensuring that she is not the first of her minions to die. 

Meanwhile, Father Petrovich's ***divine eminence*** feature has been modified to allow the players to reap its benefits and ensure that the encounter is not too deadly, as well as to ensure that martial characters without access to magical weapons can deal substantive damage despite the vampires' resistances to nonmagical weapon damage.
