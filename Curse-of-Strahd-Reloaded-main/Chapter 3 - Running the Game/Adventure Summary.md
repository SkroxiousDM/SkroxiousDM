# Act I: Into the Mists
<div class="subtitle"><em>For 2nd to 3rd-level characters.</em></div>
In this act, the players are lured into the haunted Death House, which mystically transports them into the land of Barovia. As the players gain their bearings, they travel to the village of Barovia, where they meet burgomaster Ismark Kolyanovich and his sister, Ireena Kolyana, and learn about the mysterious Strahd von Zarovich, a vampire that has recently awoken to plague the Barovian valley. 

The players are asked to escort Ireena to the nearby town of Vallaki for safety; if the players agree, Ireena also asks them to assist in the burial of her late father, Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich. While at the local church, the players meet Doru, a **vampire spawn** at war with his bloodthirsty nature, and have an opportunity to reconcile him with his father, the priest Donavich.

Upon receiving a warning and invitation sent in a dream from the Vistani seer Madam Eva, the players depart the village of Barovia for a Vistani encampment at nearby Tser Pool. Following a brief encounter with Strahd himself, the players receive a mystical Tarokka reading from Madam Eva, who foretells the location of three mystical artifacts—and a companion—who will help them defeat Strahd.

As the players travel to Madam Eva's camp and the nearby town of Vallaki, they encounter a number of characters with ties to possible future adventures, as well as some adversarial encounters that will test their tactics, coordination, and combat skill.

Upon their arrival in Vallaki, the players can find shelter at the Blue Water Inn, and—if she is with them—help Ireena seek shelter at St. Andral’s Church. The act ends when the players take their first long rest in Vallaki.
# Act II: The Shadowed Town
<div class="subtitle"><em>For characters of 4th level and higher.</em></div>
In this act, the players are left to explore the shadowed town of Vallaki—a Barovian settlement that has fallen to tension and conflict in the wake of Strahd's awakening.

As the players seek to complete lingering obligations—escorting Ireena to St. Andral's Church, purchasing and delivering a toy for the Vistani child Arabelle, and uncovering the *Tome of Strahd*—they meet new allies and enemies, including Father Lucian, the priest of St. Andral's Church; Izek Strazni, Baron Vallakovich's brutal enforcer; and Lady Fiona Wachter, the Baron's Strahd-loyalist rival.

At St. Andral's Church, the players will be tasked with recovering the stolen bones of St. Andral in order to protect the church's holy protection. At the nearby Vistani encampment, the players will have an opportunity to prove themselves heroes by finding and rescuing Arabelle following her mysterious disappearance—and receive a mysterious prophecy if they do. And at Wachterhaus, the ancestral home of House Wachter, the players will be given a choice: slay Izek Strazni and allow Lady Wachter to seize power—or do nothing, and allow the Baron's mad reign to continue.

Meanwhile, one of the players begins to experience haunting apparitions, leading them to discover the tragic fate of Stella Wachter's soul—and an opportunity to restore her broken mind. Simultaneously, a nocturnal killer haunts Vallaki's streets, secretly working to drive the disguised vampire hunter Dr. Rudolph van Richten out of hiding.

Through it all, the players will have an opportunity to seek out clues leading to the hidden location of the *Tome of Strahd*, which—depending on the Tarokka reading they received—may be hidden in the Baron's mansion or in Wachterhaus. And as the date of the Festival of the Blazing Sun approaches, Izek Strazni and Ireena Kolyana grow closer to a fateful, yet tragic encounter.

Act II ends when the players reach 5th level. However, the players can still complete unresolved arcs from this act even after Act III begins—assuming, of course, that those arcs are still possible to complete.
# Act III: The Devil's Hand
<div class="subtitle"><em>For characters of 5th level and higher.</em></div>

In this act, the players receive a plea from Urwin Martikov to investigate the Wizard of Wines winery—and an invitation from Strahd to dine at Castle Ravenloft.

If the players agree to Urwin's request, they are joined by Muriel Vinshaw—the secret identity of the disguised **wereraven** that they rescued near Tser Pool. As the players work to free the winery from the scourge of druids and blights that have invaded it, Muriel relays an excerpt of Strahd's foretelling to Davian Martikov, an elder **wereraven** and the leader of the Keepers of the Feather.

Upon freeing the winery from the druids' clutches, Davian asks them to journey to Yester Hill to the south, where the druids are plotting a dark ritual that threatens the vineyard's destruction. Upon defeating the druids, the players will have an opportunity to speak with Strahd by the Whispering Wall and to learn of the hidden settlement of Soldav from Kavan, the spirit of an ancient Mountain Folk chieftain.

Once the players have recovered the winery's stolen gemstone and returned it to Davian Martikov, they can learn the true nature of the Keepers of the Feather and gain Muriel's knowledge of Strahd's cryptic fortunetelling.

Should the players accept Strahd's invitation to dine at Ravenloft, they will be escorted by Strahd's black carriage to the castle, where they will meet Strahd's servants, brides, and consorts. After dining with Strahd himself and learning of the castle's history, the players will have an opportunity to tour the castle, to dance with Strahd's brides, and—if they choose—to solve a brief mystery on Strahd's behalf.

Act III ends when the players complete or refuse both the Martikovs' quest and Strahd's dinner invitation. However, the players can still complete the Martikovs' quest until the end of Act IV, at which point the **tree blight** Wintersplinter destroys the winery if the druids' ritual hasn't already been stopped.
# Act IV: The Broken Land
<div class="subtitle"><em>For characters of 6th level and higher.</em></div>
In this act, the players have an opportunity to delve more deeply into the hooks they've received into the western portion of the valley, including the **revenant's** invitation to Argynvostholt, the location of the *Holy Symbol of Ravenkind*, and the identity of Strahd's foretold enemy.

Upon gaining access to the village of Krezk, the players will have an opportunity to assist Baron Dmitri Krezkov in finding and rescuing his son, Ilya—a secret **werewolf** like his father—from the hidden werewolf den nearby. There, the players can meet Zuleika Toranescu, a **werewolf** priestess of Mother Night who asks them to rescue her mate, Emil, from the dungeons of Castle Ravenloft in exchange for the *Holy Symbol of Ravenkind*.

While within Krezk, the players can also meet the Abbot of the Abbey of Saint Markovia, a **deva**. Though the players can accept the Abbot's request to obtain a wedding dress from Vallaki in exchange for his resurrection magic, the spirit of Saint Markovia warns them that he has fallen from grace—and that they must obtain the holy symbol of the cleric Tasha Petrovna from the catacombs of Ravenloft in order to restore him.

Should the players visit Argynvostholt, the former headquarters of the Order of the Silver Dragon, they can learn the ancient history of the Order—and the nature of its current schism. From Sir Godfrey Gwilym, they can also learn that Kasimir Velikov, a dusk elf **mage**, shares an interest in the mysterious Amber Temple and has attempted to visit it in the recent past.

As the players explore the mansion, the spirit of Argynvost himself will set them a dangerous task: to recover his remains from the Hall of Bones in Castle Ravenloft. If the players assisted Lady Fiona Wachter in becoming Burgomaster in Act II, Vallaki's forthcoming "Blood Tax" can provide a night on which Strahd will be absent from the castle—and therefore present a perfect opportunity for a heist.

If the players infiltrate Castle Ravenloft, they can recover Argynvost's skull from the Hall of Bones, Emil Toranescu from the castle dungeons, and Tasha Petrovna's holy symbol from the catacombs beneath the castle. Along the way, they'll likely do battle with any or all of Strahd's brides.

By returning Argynvost's skull to Argynvostholt, the players can relight the beacon of the Order of the Silver Dragon, bringing hope to the valley and allowing the revenants' spirits to find peace. By rescuing Emil, they can gain a powerful ally in defeating the current leader of the werewolf pack, Kiril Stoyanovich, and win the *Holy Symbol of Ravenkind*. Finally, by obtaining Tasha Petrovna's holy symbol and defeating the Abbot in combat, the players can restore the grace of his divine spirit, providing Krezk with a mighty protector.

Act IV ends when the players recruit Kasimir to journey to the Amber Temple. However, the players can still complete unresolved arcs from this act even after Act V begins—assuming, of course, that those arcs are still possible to complete.
# Act V: Secrets of the Ancient
<div class="subtitle"><em>For characters of 8th level and higher.</em></div>
In this act, the players journey with the dusk elf Kasimir Velikov to the Amber Temple, traveling along Tsolenka Pass as they ascend Mount Ghakis. As they do, they can befriend the Mountain Folk of Soldav, including Elder Burebis, an ancient **storm giant** and devotee of the Ladies Three. From Burebis, the players can learn of the three Fanes of Barovia, and of the profane knowledge that Strahd took from the Amber Temple to desecrate them.


After overcoming the trials of Mount Ghakis's slopes, including Strahd's chamberlain Rahadin, the **giant goat** Sangzor, multiple fiends corrupted by the Amber Temple, and the **roc** of Mount Ghakis itself, the players can finally arrive at their destination. Within the Amber Temple, the players can obtain the broken hilt of the *Sunsword*, as well as the arcane secrets that Strahd used to corrupt the Barovian Fanes—and which can, in turn, be used to restore them.

Upon restoring the memory of the **lich** Exethanter and sharing with him the schematics found in the *Tome of Strahd*, the players can also learn Strahd's ultimate plan: to channel the power of the Fanes into the indestructible Heart of Sorrow within Castle Ravenloft, which Strahd will use to tear open the Mists and escape. The players will also learn that Strahd plans to consume the souls of all Barovia in order to power his audacious scheme, and that he cannot ever truly be killed unless severed from the Fanes' power.

With the broken hilt of the *Sunsword* in their hands, the players are called by a mysterious voice to return to the Shrine of the White Sun in Krezk. There, they can meet the spirit of Sergei von Zarovich, who offers to use the power of the blessed pool to restore the *Sunsword's* radiant blade. 

If Ireena still accompanies the players, Sergei invites her to take sanctuary with him—an offer which she denies if the players have treated her with kindness and courage. If she rejects him, Sergei advises Ireena to journey to the ruined manor in Berez, where a wandering spirit can help her learn the true nature of Strahd's curse—and her own.

Soon after descending Mount Ghakis, the players also learn that the swamp-witch Baba Lysaga has sealed the Wizard of Wines and Blue Water Inn within dual *mirage arcane* spells and taken Muriel Vinshaw prisoner at her creeping hut—and that she plans to return with an army of wereraven-slaying **strix** to exterminate the Keepers of the Feather for good.

In Berez, the players can do battle with Baba Lysaga, freeing Muriel and the swarms of other ravens that Baba Lysaga has kept captive. Should the players bring Ireena to Marina's Monument nearby, they can also encounter the **ghost** of Burgomaster Lazlo Ulrich, the father of Marina Ulrich—one of Ireena's past lives. 

Ulrich can guide the party to Marina's Monument within the swamp, where Ireena can experience the deaths of her past lives and learn the terrible truth: that, in order to escape Strahd's predation, each of her past lives ultimately accepted the gift of the Dark Powers themselves—the oblivion of death. With the players' aid, Ireena can defy the Dark Powers' temptations and reclaim a power of defiance and hope.

Act V ends when the players first enter the Swamp Fane (in Berez), Mountain Fane (by Old Bonegrinder), or Forest Fane (on Yester Hill). However, the players can still complete unresolved arcs from this act until all three Fanes have been reconsecrated—at which point all quests will become impossible to complete.
# Act VI: The Curse of Strahd
<div class="subtitle"><em>For characters of 9th level and higher.</em></div>
In this act, the players reconsecrate the Swamp Fane, the Mountain Fane, and the Forest Fane. Soon after the last Fane is restored, however, Strahd's masterstroke unfolds. By releasing the stored energy bound within the Heart of Sorrow, Strahd plunges Barovia into an eternal night—and turns the valley itself into desecrated ground. 

As an undead apocalypse threatens to overwhelm the Barovian people, the players must journey to Castle Ravenloft to face Strahd at the Heart of Sorrow. As the final battle unfolds, the Heart of Sorrow shows visions of Strahd's undead siege from across Barovia—and of the heroic resistance shown by the allies and friends that the players have made across their journey:

***Village of Barovia.*** If the players escorted Ireena to Vallaki, reconciled Doru with Father Donavich, befriended Dr. Rudolph van Richten in Vallaki, and inspired Ireena to reject Sergei's invitation, the village of Barovia is saved by the leadership and prowess of Ismark Kolyanovich, Doru and Donavich, Dr. Van Richten and the **ghost** Erasmus van Richten, and the spirit of Sergei von Zarovich.

***Town of Vallaki.*** If the players restored the soul of Stella Wachter, aided Lady Fiona Wachter in defeating Izek Strazni, located the missing Vistana Arabelle, recovered the stolen bones of St. Andral, and rescued the Blue Water Inn from Baba Lysaga, the town of Vallaki is saved by the power and foresight of Lady Fiona Wachter and her cult; the young **mage** Victor Vallakovich; the Vistani Luvash, Arrigal, and Arabelle; the dusk elves; the priest Father Lucian Petrovich; and the **wereravens** Urwin Martikov and Danika Dorakova.

***Village of Krezk.*** If the players rescued Ilya Krezkov from the Werewolf Den, rescued Emil Toranescu from the dungeons of Castle Ravenloft, and restored the Abbot's divine grace, the village of Krezk is saved by the might and savagery of the redeemed Abbot, the Belview **mongrelfolk**, the Krezkov **werewolves**, and Emil's new **werewolf** pack.

***Wizard of Wines.*** If the players saved the Wizard of Wines from the druids and Wintersplinter, defeated Baba Lysaga, and relit the beacon of Argynvostholt, the winery is saved by the combined efforts of the Keepers of the Feather and the spirits of the Order of the Silver Dragon.

***Settlement of Soldav.*** If the players aided the Mountain Folk within the Amber Temple and reconsecrated the Fanes of Barovia, the settlement of Soldav is saved by the sudden arrival of the Mountain Folk warrior Helwa, the chieftain Kavan and his warband of spirits, the bestial spirits of the Huntress, and the **roc** of Mount Ghakis itself.

Should the players defeat Strahd, the Mists vanish and the sun rises over Barovia once again—a free land, at long last.
