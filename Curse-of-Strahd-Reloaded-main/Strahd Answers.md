**Are you undead?**

*"Undead? I find the term offensive, for I am immortal, not one of those vile and mindless beings you find lurking in the shadows. While my nature may be distinct from that of the mortal realm, I do take pleasure in similar social conventions."*

**Are you after Ireena?**

*"After Ireena? Certainly not. I am not some infatuated mortal simpleton in pursuit of a woman. Rather, I hold a deep fondness, admiration, and sense of devotion towards her well-being. I am willing to do anything and everything in my power to ensure that she is safe and protected."*

Be honest with yourself, child. Do you really think you can stop me? I knew you were going to...(insert thing here). I am more intelligent than you. I don’t mean to condescend, that’s just a fact. (beat) “Condescend” is a word that means “talk down to.” You understand?"

"Everyone thinks they are the heroes of their own stories."
