# Ability Scores via Stat Banks
Ability Scores are determined by Stat Banks. Stat banks are 23/25/27.

To determine scores, roll 4d6 drop lowest 1. Do this three times. These are the first half of your scores. (Example: 7, 11, 17)

Subtract your rolls from the banks in order of roll. The results are the second half of your scores. (23 - 7 = 16, 25 - 11 = 14, 27 - 17 = 10)

Use these six scores for your abilities as you wish.
(7, 11, 17, 16, 14, 10)

No stat before racials can be below a 7 or above an 18. Simply raise and lower them to the limits. (A roll of 18/5 on the first bank of 23 would be 16/7)
