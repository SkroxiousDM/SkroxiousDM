| d20  |  Complication |
|---|---|
|1|Loner: Your trust is not easily earned. Even those you do trust, you never trust completely. You think everyone should be able to take care of themselves; if they can’t, it’s their own fault.

Even if you’re a fighter, you’d rather slit a man’s throat than risk a fair fight.<br><br>As things turn against the character, they do not stand fast. Rather, they are prepared to change their convictions, serve those who are stronger, and abandon those who rely upon them.|

When they are overcome by this, their lust for valuables will overtake any rational impulse.|

It helps you sleep, or forget, or remember.<br><br>This character seeks refuge in earthly pleasure, seeking to dull their minds against pain and sorrow by drunkenness.|
|8|Resentful: You grow bitter at perceived slights. You remember all wrongs against you and allow them to fester in your heart.

|12|Intolerant: You are strongly partial to your own creed and intolerant of others. You favor those who appear similar to you almost as much as you dislike those who do not.<br><br>Some idea or cause provides this character with meaning, and the worse things get, the more they will double down on it and seek to remove all threats to it.|
|13|Fanatic: You have excessive zeal for a particular subject. Perhaps you are extremely religious, or unshakably devoted to a leader or cause. The ends always justify vicious means. Sometimes you do things for your group that they wouldn’t agree with, but you do it for their own good.<br><br>Some idea or cause provides this character with meaning, and the worse things get, the more they will double down on it and seek to remove all threats to it.|
