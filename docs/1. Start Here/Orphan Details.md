# Orphan Details

 The orphan protagonist is an extremely popular trope in fantasy fiction. It makes a very convenient background for adventurers, as it cuts roots that would keep most people in one place. It also provides a simple motivation to adventure. Perhaps because it’s so convenient, it is easy for an orphan character’s background to be ignored. Flesh out your backstory by choosing new details from the following lists.

###  A Mystery

- On the day my parents were buried, the sun was blotted out by swarming crows.  
- The details of my parents’ deaths do not match from story to story.  
- I was marked with a tattoo that has no obvious meaning.  
- I heard a tale about someone whose description matches one of my parents. This person was seen long after my parents’ supposed deaths.  
- There is no witness account of the attack that killed my parents—just physical evidence.  
- The person who left me with my caretakers only spoke a cryptic phrase.

###  A Person

 Creating a character related to your orphan’s backstory helps physicalize the story. The character can create a goal to seek, something that moves and leaves clues. Whether it is the villain who killed your parents or the mysterious figure who left your character with the people who raised you, identifying details make it easier to use that backstory in the unfolding narrative.   

- He wore armor as black as night.  
- In the rain and shadow, you could see her glowing eyes.
- They wore a crest with a coat of arms you have never seen. 
- She had a deformity that would be instantly recognizable. 
- He spoke a name that raised more questions than it answered. 
- They stole an item from you that you know like your own shadow. 

###  An Artifact

 Objects provide a connection to your backstory. They can continue to pose old questions while opening new doors. Among the objects your orphan character may have are:  

- A scroll written in a strange language. 
- A weapon once possessed by one of your parents, now safe at your side. 
- A jewel of unusual quality, which seems to sparkle even in darkness. 
- The hand of the creature that killed your parents, untouched by rot.
- A heavy key with elaborate grooves.
- The journal of one of your parents, from which a few important pages are missing. 

### An Identity

Losing a family is inherently tragic, but it is easier to investigate if those people were well known. It gives the world reasons to embrace or impede your character’s quest. Most players identify a profession for their character’s deceased parents, but creating a personality for them will have a larger impact on the story. Decide if your parents were among the following:

-   Revolutionary iconoclasts
-   Faithful champions of their community
-   Innovative thinkers at the forefront of their field
-   Righteous symbols of hope and prosperity
-   Cutthroat opportunists
-   Outlaws and warlords

# Personality

Now that you’ve laid the foundations of your character's past, you'll switch focus to their personality and tastes. What kind of employment is your character familiar with? Do they have any particular quirks or phobias? What event or events in their life gave your character these personality traits?
