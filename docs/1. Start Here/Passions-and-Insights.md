# Passions and Dreadful Insights
Have you ever watched a horror movie and were boggled at a character’s obliviousness? On a dark and stormy night, with creepy shadows lurking about, our main character insists on sticking their head into a darkened closet or tramping down into the bloodstained basement with only a flickering candle.

Characters in horror games are driven by their passions, rather than cold, analytical thinking. A determined investigator plunges into the ghost-haunted graveyard, willing to risk anything to prove that the supernatural exists. A hardened warrior coats their spearhead in molten silver, caring little if they survive an encounter with a werewolf so long as they have the chance to avenge their lost family.

A Passion is a belief that shapes your character’s actions. It might send you into a dangerous situation, but it also offers benefits that help offset the peril it causes.

A Insight is a revelation about the horrors in the world that leaves your beliefs shaken and your concept of reality changed in some way. Some cosmic horrors, through their mere existence, grant insights into reality that many folk would prefer to do without. When you gain a Insight, it forces you to confront the nature of reality and your irrelevant place in it.

## Overview
During the game, you might face a situation where your Passion can push you into danger. You can act according to the Passion or try to resist it. Acting with your Passion grants you a benefit, even if it puts you into danger. Resisting it might allow you to dodge trouble, but it comes at a cost.
### Gaining Passions
You start play with one Passion of your choice. You can create a Passion or use one of the example ones provided below.
### Creating a Passion
A good passion should drive you into action. Here are some guidelines to consider when brainstorming a passion.
#### A Passion Demands Action
A passion must push you to do things, rather than force you into inaction. When a passion urges you to act, it should move you forward into danger rather than push you into a passive stance.
#### A Passion Needs External Triggers
If you can always control when a passion comes into play, it lacks the ability to drive your actions. A good passion has an external source, one that draws you forward into the game.
#### A Passion Has an Element of Risk
The best passions for gaming have the potential to destroy you if you take them too far. Push too deep into secrets, and you risk falling prey to dark forces. A passion should push you toward risks, rather than encourage careful, calculating moves.
## Using Passions
There are two ways to use Passions.
### Invoking a Passion
When you make a d20 Test, you can add a +5 bonus to the roll if the GM agrees that the roll is directly related to your Passion and what it means to you. You choose to do this before rolling. Once you use any Passion in this way, you cannot gain this benefit again until you embrace your passion, as described below.
### Following a Passion
During the game, the GM can challenge you to follow a Passion. When you face a choice, the GM can present a course of action that aligns with one of your Passions. You have two choices.
- **Embrace Your Passion**. You follow the GM’s suggestion or offer an alternative that they agree matches your Passion. In return, you gain Heroic Inspiration and Temporary Hit Points equal to 5 + your level.
- **Deny Your Passion**. Alternatively, you can attempt to resist your passion. Roll a d20. If the result is 10 or higher, you resist your passion and can act as you wish. If you roll 9 or lower, your conflict with your Passion shakes you. You cannot gain or use Heroic Inspiration until you finish a Long Rest.
## Losing and Replacing a Passion
You can replace a Passion with a new one of your choice when it has been resolved. If a Passion drives you to expose a corrupt priest, it is no longer relevant when you have slain the priest or brought their crimes to light. You might also decide that a Passion is no longer relevant to the campaign or your character’s interests. You might swear vengeance against a foe who wronged you, or a crisis might turn your beliefs upside down.

You should create your new Passion in collaboration with your GM. You can select one based on events of the campaign or how your character might evolve after bringing their passion to an end.
## Example Passions
This section includes a variety of Passions you can use as models for your own creations. 
### Arcane Hunger
You crave arcane power. Where others see lines that should not be crossed, you see an invitation to plunge into unknown territory where great insights and power await. You care nothing for social niceties and tradition when it comes to gaining power. Anything, even your life, is worth risking to uncover the innerworkings of the arcane.
### Devoted Faith
You are an ardent support of a deity, to the point that your deity’s ethos overrides almost every other concern you face. If you had to choose between your own safety, or even your own life, and your deity’s dictates, you might very well make the ultimate sacrifice rather than give an inch. If you select this Passion, be sure to talk to your GM about the deities in the campaign and which ones might be a good match for your character.
### Hatred
You have a deep, overwhelming hatred for a person, faction, creature, or deity. You act against your own self-interest at times to lash out at it. You’d die happy knowing that you gave your life to destroy the object of your hatred. Check with your DM to find a figure our group in your campaign that is a good match for this Passion.
### Haunted
You have vague memories of a strange event that happened to you many years ago. The memory is a blur, a kaleidoscope of impressions, sounds, and images, but nothing concrete. Yet sometimes you come across a person, a place, a sound, or even a scent that tugs at that memory, compelling you to investigate and solve this strange mystery that has lingered in your mind.
### Heroic Impulse
You are driven by a deep selflessness, one that pushes you to confront evil in any form. Unfortunately, your sense of self-preservation rarely factors into your thinking. You tend to dive into danger without thinking of the consequences, leaving you in situations that are over your head.
### Insatiable Curiosity
You are driven to uncover secrets, regardless of the danger it might pose to yourself. The thought of lore or information that exists outside of your awareness can drive you to distraction. You have a bad habit of listening in on conversations and poking into places that others warn you away from.
### Justice for All
You can’t abide bullies, tyrants, or those who use power to abuse others. When you witness the misuse of power, you can’t help but take a stand against it. You have been known to trade the thrill of punching a town guard in the face for a two week stint in the baron’s dungeon. In your mind, that moment was worth it.
### Loyalty
You are loyal to a group, a nation, or an ideal, gladly putting its own interests above your all regardless of the cost. You are willing to risk your life and limb to advance the cause. Its needs stand above you in almost every situation. If you choose this Passion, be sure to talk to your DM about factions, people, or causes in the campaign that fit with your character.
### Seeker of Forbidden Truths
The world is far more dangerous than anyone lets us know. Temples lie to us. Wizards think they understand how magic works, but it’s all a stack of comforting lies. You are driven to expose the fraud that is the current religious and arcane traditions. You seek out strange magic, weird creatures, and bizarre situations to prove your theories correct.
### Skeptical To a Fault
The mythos? Clearly a folktale, the deranged ravings of a mind saddled crippled by illness. The world and its secrets have been laid bare by the teachings of the gods and the traditions of arcane magic. When you find signs of strange phenomena, you are compelled to investigate and dispel any nonsense about it.
### Survivor’s Guilt
You survived a terrible incident, one that has haunted you ever since. Above all else, you remember the terrible fate that befell your friends or loved ones in that incident. Since then, you have been driven a near self-destructive urge to ensure that such a disaster never happens again.
### Thirst for Vengeance
Someone or something wronged you. You are driven to even the score and are willing to accept any cost to yourself to do so. Your focus sometimes gives you tunnel vision, leading you to disregard all other concerns to smash your enemies.
### Wealth at Any Cost
You want wealth. You’ve seen the power and comfort that comes from amassing a fortune, and you want that for yourself more than anything else in the world. Offers of riches and plunder tug at your mind, making it difficult for you to resist them.
# Dreadful Insights
A Dreadful Insight is a Passion you gain based on your experiences with the Cthulhu mythos. At their core, the creatures of the Mythos show that the universe is a vast, uncaring place. Mortals are an accidental byproduct of a cosmic cycle that they are irrelevant to. Seeing that firsthand can shake your grip on reality and leave you with deep emotional scars.
## Gaining a Dreadful Insight
Some creatures or events risk giving you a Dreadful Insight. Typically, you must make a Wisdom saving throw to resist fully understanding the Insight you might gain. If you succeed the save, your willpower holds and you are able to create a comforting explanation for what you witnessed. If you fail, you gain a Dreadful Insight, a new Passion that shapes how you act. The underlying truth of the Mythos pushes into your mind and brings the full weight of the Mythos to bear on you.
## Using a Dreadful Insight
A Dreadful Insight works just like any other Passion, except it tends to pull you along a self-destructive path. You might become fascinated with a Mythos entity and compelled to encounter it, or you might become obsessed with a tome of ancient knowledge and driven to master its secrets at any cost.
## Losing a Dreadful Insight
Each Dreadful Insight also describes how to lose it. In most cases, you must take actions that resolve the intellectual and emotional turmoil that the Insight provokes in you. You might need to defeat a creature that created the Insight, undo the damage caused by the mythos in the world, or prove to yourself that you matter in an uncaring cosmos.

Once you lose a Dreadful Insight in this manner, you can’t gain it again. You have overcome the Insight and are at peace with it.

## Dreadful Insights
Those who encounter the Cthulhu Mythos risk gaining a Insight, a compulsion to dig deeper into the Mythos. You can use any of the following Dreadful Insights. The Wisdom saving throw DC to avoid gaining a Insight is 8 + the creature’s Charisma + its proficiency bonus. You make this saving throw the first time you encounter a Mythos creature after
finishing a long rest.

If more than one character is at risk of gaining a Insight, apply it to the character who rolled the lowest Saving Throw among those who risked gaining it. Dreadful Insights work best when they apply to one character at a time, as they create tension between the Mythos’ effect on a character and the rest of the party’s grip on reality.

Each Insight includes a note about the types of creatures that can confer it.
### Call of the Crushing Depths
Source. Dagon, Deep Ones, and their associated allies. Aquatic Mythos creatures.

The sea calls to you. You hear the distant clash of waves against the shore, no matter how far you are from the ocean. You are drawn to the sea, feeling a nearly irresistible urge to take to the sea and heed its call. You have no idea where this call might take you, but when you sleep you sometimes dream of a distant, malevolent mind that watches you from the deepest, darkest reaches of the sea. Perhaps you will someday meet the entity behind these eyes and confront them.
### Crippling Aversion
Source. Any Mythos creatures.

Your encounter with the Mythos has left you shaken. Your mind has fixated on some element of the creature, rite, or object you saw. It now triggers a primordial aversion in you, but at the same time you cannot help but obsess over it. You seek out information and lore related to the Mythos element that gave you this Insight, even as it wracks you with fear.
### Dreams of Ruin
Source. Cthulhu, his allies, and his cult.

Your nights are plagued with horrid dreams of a city sunk beneath leagues of black, crushing water. Something dreadful slumbers there, something awful and hungry. Yet despite its clear malevolence, you find yourself drawn to its presence. A phrase echoes though your mind: Ia! Ia! Cthulhu fhtagn! Any shred of information about this creature and its origin must be yours. If only you could understand this thing, draw it to the surface, wake it up fully, allow it to rule the world as it... no, it must be destroyed. That is why you seek its secrets. That is why you pursue it. To destroy it. Yes. That is why.
### Grave Obsession
Source. Undead associated with the Mythos.

The specter of death hovers over you. You are all too painfully aware of your inevitable demise, but now you know that something far worse than the afterlife awaits you. You obsess over graveyards, tombs, and other places where the dead rest. You are convinced that the secret of immortality, or the key to unlocking the truth behind death, is hidden somewhere in the world. By contacting ghosts, undead creatures, or learning the secrets of the Mythos, you can transcend death and become immortal.
### Misplaced Faith
Source. Mi-go, Yithians other intelligent Mythos entities.

The creatures of the Mythos cannot be so utterly alien that you cannot reason with them. You refuse to believe that intelligent creatures could lack all sense of mortality and respect for life. You are obsessed with finding a way to communicate with Mythos entities that you deem to be intelligent and potentially reasonable. You are quick to write off their horrid acts as misunderstandings, and seek to build a bridge that can create a bright future for all.
### Primordial Soul
Source. Shub Niggurath, her minions and cultists. Wilderness Mythos creatures.

Civilization and its trappings are a lie. The truth behind all reality lies out in the wild, where life runs rampant and all living things may do as they please. Rules, laws, and other artificial constraints serve only to bind you to the will of others. You are obsessed with the idea that the Cthulhu Mythos represents the true nature of reality. By throwing aside civilization and its trappings, you can venture into the wilds and find the true nature of life and reality.
