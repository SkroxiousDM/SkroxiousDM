> Barovia have been dark for centuries, yet a faint hope remains. The
> book in this box will tell you its true history. Read it, know it, and

> land. That hope flourishes in you as well. Barovia’s time is coming.
> Your time is coming.
> A small camp lies near Tser Falls. There, a man called Petra
> resides. Your grandfather helped raise him and kept him out of
> trouble. Show him the book—he will know where it came from. He
> may be a friend when you have none.
