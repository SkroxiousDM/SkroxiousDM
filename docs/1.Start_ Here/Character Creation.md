# Using this Primer

Character creation is an important aspect of Dungeons & Dragons, but creating a compelling character and backstory can be difficult. The purpose of this primer is to inspire players’ creativity and help develop unique characters that they may have not considered without rolling on the following tables.

This primer should also help target player character backstories towards the Curse of Strahd campaign setting, allowing the Dungeon Master to better integrate them into the narrative.

It's possible you already have a strong character concept in mind, in which case you may not need to use all the tables available in this primer. However, if you feel you need more detail, you can consult the tables, either picking the idea that fits best or rolling for a truly random addition to your character concept. Ultimately, you’ll want to consult with your Dungeon Master to be sure your player character will work for the campaign.

Should you choose to create a character entirely by rolling, it may be more fun to avoid reading all the available options to maintain a sense of surprise. Additionally, to achieve the best results, it’s recommended that this guide be used in a session zero with other players to help build bonds and foster connections between the members of the adventuring party.

# Backstory

The following tables will help you discover your character's origins. First, you’ll start with your character’s hometown and family composition. Afterward, you’ll figure out a few of the more important relationships in their lives.

## Hometown

### Where I’m From
Create a snapshot of where you came from and how it shaped the person you became. Pick details to inspire you and use them to answer the prompts.

### Choose a Size for Your Town
#### Metropolis
A sprawling city with thousands, perhaps millions of inhabitants. People and goods from many different places around the globe make their way through a place like this. Despite being surrounded by people, it is easy to feel alone and lost here. Wealth and poverty live beside each other in stark juxtaposition. Infrastructure is vast and almost impossible for a single person to comprehend.

#### Town
Home to hundreds or perhaps even a thousand inhabitants. Although there is a sharp social division between the ruling and serving classes, no one is separated by more than two or three degrees. Even the people not known to you by name are familiar in appearance. There are many organized institutions that make life in this place possible.

#### Village
Home to at most a few hundred. It is easily possible to know everyone by name and profession. There can be no real anonymity because anyone trying to conceal her or his business quickly becomes known for being mysterious. Settlement is permanent, if disorganized. Many structures are grouped together out of convenience rather than careful planning.

#### Tribe
Home to at most a few dozen. Civic and familial bonds are blurred. Community obligations are approached with grave seriousness. A tribe can be tied to a permanent location or an idea carried by nomadic people.

#### Pack
A small group. Even if not related by blood, members treat one another as family, with all the emotion, obligation, and loyalty that come with it. A pack can weave in and out of larger communities or shun civilization altogether.

### Where Did You Call Home?
For some characters this is a permanent room or residence. For others it is an abstract feeling about certain periods of safety and stability. Finding those truths for your character will help you understand how he or she approaches the concept of home on the road.

  Where did you most often sleep? ________________________
  What did you need to do to maintain it? ________________________
  Did it protect you and what you cared for? ________________________
  Do you long for it now? ________________________

### Where Did People Socialize?
There are places of merriment and relaxation everywhere. This exercise will examine one of particular importance to your character.

  Choose two:
  The hearth was always warm when the wind was cold.
  The music moves your heart even in memory.
  The owner was wise or at least gave advice as though he were.
  The food was cooked with quiet pride.
  It always seemed to hold a dazzling glow.
  Being there faded the weight of obligation just enough.
  You watched more than you took part.

  But . . . (choose one)
  You rarely left with a full belly.
  Everything was watered down.
  It drew the most dangerous thugs and criminals.
  You were often present but never welcome.
  The spell it cast wore off all too quickly.
  You risked everything to be there.
  You could never ignore where the money went.

  What was it officially titled? ________________________
  What did people call it? ________________________

### What Did People Respect?
Where people assign their respect shows us what they value. To get an idea of the values held by the people of your hometown, select everything you believe is true.

  People respected . . .
  Power
  Authority
  Cunning
  Nature
  Wealth
  Ambition
  The divine
  One another
  The law
  Life
  Love
  Strength
  Wisdom
  Knowledge
  Skill
  Discovery
  Justice

  Are these values you hold today? ________________________
  How do your personal values differ?

### Who Was in Charge?
Any collective is under the rule of some other force. Even those who reject rule by other creatures are subject to the will of law or nature. This exercise explores the relationship between your character and authority.

  The force in charge of your hometown: (choose two)
	Was a thing of power and majesty
	Never spoke but was always heard
	Ruled with wisdom
	Demanded loyalty
	Understood kindness
	Worked diligently
	Was controlled by another
	Earned your hatred
	Was the product of divine right

  But . . . (choose one)
	  It was worthy of respect.
	  It killed without thought.
	  It made many mistakes.
	  It aged and died.
	  It was eventually overthrown.
	  It expected much from me.

  What was the ruler’s name?
  Based on this experience, when you picture a ruler, what does he, she, or they look like?
  If given the chance to lead, whom would you emulate?

### What Was Your Place?
Perhaps the single thing that most dramatically colors your character’s perception of place of origin is her or his place in it. It is useless to know your character was a student, noble, or blacksmith if you do not understand how he or she feels about it. Finding this will solidify what your character is running away from and toward.

  I was: (choose one)
  Safe
  Respected
  Worshipped
  Ignored
  Hated
  Feared
  Mistreated

  My duty was to: (choose one)
  Learn
  Grow
  Protect
  Provide
  Serve
  Die

  Which I: (choose one)
  Humbly accepted
  Regretfully fulfilled
  Actively resisted
  Desperately ran from
  Painfully failed
  Continue to carry out

  If you could return to this role, would you?
  Not if the chains of hell dragged me back.
  No, I am now unworthy.
  No, I am too important.
  I don’t know.
  Yes, with great sorrow.
  Yes, but this time would be different.
  Yes, with great pride.

Discovering your character’s hometown will help determine the foundation of their backstory. While the table below will provide a home or birthplace for your character, it is up to you to determine your character's relationship with that location. Was your character both born and raised in this location? Or were they born elsewhere, but have lived in this settlement the majority of their lives? Is your character well traveled or have they rarely left their hometown? The details are yours to develop.

Roll on the table below to discover your character's hometown.

##### City: Yndaros



##### Town: Thistlehold

Thistle

##### Town: Kastor

Located north of the High Moor, Secomber is a small town famed for its judicial system, which was used as a base for most law and order in the settlements of the Sword Coast. Now, the town is home to fishermen, farmers, and, to a lesser degree, stonemasons. Guides are often hired from Secomber to help navigate the moor.

##### Town: Templewall

Goldenfields is a small town surrounded by vast and beautiful farmland, orchards, and gardens. The town itself surrounds a grand temple and abbey to Chauntea, the goddess of harvest.

##### Village: Julkoun

Julkoun is a small farming settlement, led by a family of halflings. The villagers worship at a small church of Chauntea.

##### Village: Bowshot

Bowshot is a roadside village and is the closest geographical settlement to the Misty Forest.

Village: Gillian’s Hill

A small and unremarkable town, Gillian's Hill is about a day’s travel south of Daggerford. It’s said that a local tomb in Gillian’s Hill has an entrance to the Underdark and occasionally has encounters with drow.

##### Village: Womford

Womford is a tiny village built around the bridge crossing the Dessarin River. The village was once called Wyrmford, after a legend boasting of a dragon killed nearby. The locals make their living working mills and granaries.

##### Unmarked Hamlet

There are a variety of other settlements along the Sword Coast, too small and unimportant to be included on most maps. These miniscule villages and hamlets are home to no more than a few dozen inhabitants each.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|d100|Home Settlement|Size|
|1 - 15|Yndaros|City|
|16 - 25|Thistlehold|Town|
|26 - 35|Kastor|Town|
|36 - 45|Templewall|Town|
|46 - 55|Julkoun|Village|
|56 - 65|Bowshot|Village|
|66 - 75|Gillian's Hill|Village|
|76 - 85|Womford|Village|
|86 - 00|Unmarked Hamlet|Hamlet|

## Family

Your family is your first social network. In the most general sense, a character’s family consists of two parents and their siblings, all of which are blood related. However, the composition of a family can vary greatly. It’s possible that your parental figure was instead a mentor or an aunt. It’s possible that you have over a dozen half-siblings from a particularly promiscuous parent and that the majority of those siblings are dead. However supportive or dysfunctional, loving or absent, your family has helped define you.

Using the size of your hometown as a base, roll on a pair of the following tables to determine the size of your family.

Family Size

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
||(City/Town)||(Village/Hamlet)|
|D100|Number of Parents|D100|Number of Parents|
|1 - 10|1d4 + 2|1 - 15|1d4 + 2|
|11 - 45|2|16 - 50|2|
|46 - 80|1|51 - 85|1|
|81 - 00|0|86 - 00|0|
|D100|Number of Siblings|D100|Number of Siblings|
|1 - 12|2d4 + 2|1 - 20|2d4 + 2|
|13 - 38|2d4 - 2|21 -50|2d4 - 2|
|39 - 88|1d4|51 - 80|1d4|
|89 - 00|0|81 - 00|0|

## Fateful Relations

Every character has or has had relationships that have helped shape their personalities. These important relations might be family, a friend, or a mentor. They might also be someone the character has wronged, creating an unfortunate rival or enemy. No matter the details, these relationships are crucial to that character.

If you encounter an inconsistency by rolling on the following chart, such as rolling an option that notes a parent but your character has no parents, you may change that option to denote a different relation, like to a sibling or friend. Roll a d4 - 1 (minimum 1) to determine your number of fateful relations. And then roll that number of times on the following chart to determine the nature of those relations.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|D100|Relationship|
|1 - 3|You once saved a small animal from dying and it has followed you ever since. Choose one beast of CR 1/8 or lower as a pet. This pet cannot help you in battle or in social encounters unless you have the magic or mechanical abilities to justify that help.|

# Orphan Details

 The orphan protagonist is an extremely popular trope in fantasy fiction. It makes a very convenient background for adventurers, as it cuts roots that would keep most people in one place. It also provides a simple motivation to adventure. Perhaps because it’s so convenient, it is easy for an orphan character’s background to be ignored. Flesh out your backstory by choosing new details from the following lists.

###  A Mystery

- On the day my parents were buried, the sun was blotted out by swarming crows.  
- The details of my parents’ deaths do not match from story to story.  
- I was marked with a tattoo that has no obvious meaning.  
- I heard a tale about someone whose description matches one of my parents. This person was seen long after my parents’ supposed deaths.  
- There is no witness account of the attack that killed my parents—just physical evidence.  
- The person who left me with my caretakers only spoke a cryptic phrase.

###  A Person

 Creating a character related to your orphan’s backstory helps physicalize the story. The character can create a goal to seek, something that moves and leaves clues. Whether it is the villain who killed your parents or the mysterious figure who left your character with the people who raised you, identifying details make it easier to use that backstory in the unfolding narrative.   

- He wore armor as black as night.  
- In the rain and shadow, you could see her glowing eyes.
- They wore a crest with a coat of arms you have never seen. 
- She had a deformity that would be instantly recognizable. 
- He spoke a name that raised more questions than it answered. 
- They stole an item from you that you know like your own shadow. 

###  An Artifact

 Objects provide a connection to your backstory. They can continue to pose old questions while opening new doors. Among the objects your orphan character may have are:  

- A scroll written in a strange language. 
- A weapon once possessed by one of your parents, now safe at your side. 
- A jewel of unusual quality, which seems to sparkle even in darkness. 
- The hand of the creature that killed your parents, untouched by rot.
- A heavy key with elaborate grooves.
- The journal of one of your parents, from which a few important pages are missing. 

### An Identity

Losing a family is inherently tragic, but it is easier to investigate if those people were well known. It gives the world reasons to embrace or impede your character’s quest. Most players identify a profession for their character’s deceased parents, but creating a personality for them will have a larger impact on the story. Decide if your parents were among the following:

-   Revolutionary iconoclasts
-   Faithful champions of their community
-   Innovative thinkers at the forefront of their field
-   Righteous symbols of hope and prosperity
-   Cutthroat opportunists
-   Outlaws and warlords

# Personality

Now that you’ve laid the foundations of your character's past, you'll switch focus to their personality and tastes. What kind of employment is your character familiar with? Do they have any particular quirks or phobias? What event or events in their life gave your character these personality traits?

## Favourite Food and Drink

The Sword Coast is home to all variety of beasts and to miles of farmland. Your character will have come into contact with all sorts of dishes and will likely have a favorite. While picking a favorite food or drink is a rather trivial detail in the long run, they're details that will help flesh out your character and bring them to life.

## Trinket

A trinket is an odd or peculiar object your character has collected. A trinket usually has no use or intrinsic value, but your character has kept it for one reason or another. Maybe the item reminds them of a dead parent or maybe it was the first thing they ever stole.

### Quirks

For the last section of personality development, you'll roll for a quirk. Everyone possesses a little eccentricity, from a curious habit to a peculiar preference. A player character should be no different.

Roll a d20 on the table below to discover your character's quirk.

###### Quirks Table

|   |   |
|---|---|
|d20.|Quirk|
|1|Birds unnerve you. You feel as though any bird perched nearby is watching you.|
|2|You have trouble sleeping with lights, such as lamps or candles, still illuminated. Any source of light will keep you awake unless extinguished or unless they are very faint, such as moonlight.|
|3|Though you have no trouble sleeping on the ground or in uncomfortable situations, you take great joy in having a comfortable bed and a room to yourself.|
|4|You hate carrying change. Should the opportunity arise, you’ll trade coppers and silver for a round number of gold coins.|
|5|You were a very small child, undergrown and short no matter how much you ate. Even after a proper growth spurt into adulthood, you have a soft spot for shorter individuals.|
|6|You have a favorite weapon which you have named.|
|7|You hate soup. No matter how well flavored or hearty, you think of soup as glorified water and avoid it if you can.|
|8|You are extremely confident in your own attractiveness. You have a habit of admiring your own reflection whenever you get the chance.|
|9|You claim to speak an exotic language. If asked to demonstrate this proficiency, you make up gibberish. No one has called you out on it so far.|
|10|You greet everyone you meet with a hug and a kiss on the cheek, no matter how unfriendly they appear. The only thing that stops this greeting is outright hostility.|
|11|Your resting face makes you appear angry. You try to smile often, less in happiness and more so people will stop asking you if you’re okay.|
|12|You take heed of any and all superstitions. Even if you don’t believe in them, you’d rather not risk ignoring a bad omen.|
|13|You are illiterate, and will stop at nothing to make sure no one knows this fact.|
|14|You believe that a mother’s love for her children is the truest love in the world.|

|16|You’re a morning person. You are the first to rise in camp and are always chipper about it.|

### Alignment

Alignments are reserved for creatures from the outer planes and creatures tightly connected to them (such as, for example, paladins and clerics).

## Beliefs

Characters are defined by their Beliefs, the fundamental ideas that drive them. Beliefs represent a Character’s explicit outlook and their Player’s goals.  They help solidify what kind of Character their Player wants them to be, what they want to do, and how they are tied to the Premise of the Campaign and the other Characters. Beliefs let the Arbiter and other Players know what you as a Player want out of the Campaign, and help you to tell a better story together. Consider the types of activities you want to experience.

#### Sample Activities:

- Skillful fighting
- Diplomatic negotiations
- Experimenting with alchemy
- Amassing a huge fortune
- Becoming a folk hero
- Pursuing romance
- Exploring the world
- Mastering swordsmanship
- Rising to power
- Seeking revenge
- Unraveling mysteries
- Defending the weak
- Making reckless choices
- Being a leader
- Acting as a skillful tactician

Beliefs are meant to be challenged. They can grow stronger or weaker, be shattered, and even betrayed.  They can change as Characters grow and develop over the course of a Campaign, or remain the solid bastions that define a Character's journey.

Any time a Character gains a level, they may alter one or more Beliefs. Altering Beliefs is not mandatory; rather, it should be done rarely and only when a large shift occurs in a Character or the narrative.

A strong Belief is a compounded Ideology and Action. They are unambiguous and have no verbal nuance. Try the following formulas:
**I think A, so I’ll do B.**
**Because of A, I want B, so I’ll do C.**

***My family is weak, and I must lead it if it is to prosper, so I must earn the favor of the Lord Thorn to ensure my position at its head.****
This Belief combines an “Idea” (My family is weak.) With “What” the Character will do about it (I must lead it if it is to prosper.) And “How” the Character intends to do it (I must earn the favor of the Lord Thorn.)

Each Player should make one Belief about some aspect of the Premise of the Campaign (World Belief),one about another Player’s Character (Other Belief),and one your Character has about themselves (Self Belief).

##  World Belief  

The World Belief directly connects your Character to a key part of the Premise of the Campaign and their goals regarding it. It could relate to a Character, a faction, impending conflict, recent disaster, or any other force requiring immediate action. Pick something that interests you as a Player, and think about your Character's opinion on it. How do they view it and feel about it? Consider how they will act based on this opinion, and what has prevented them from doing so already, or what stands in their way now. The DM may want to use this Belief to unite the Players under a common cause. Using our previous example, they might say the Campaign is about an impending disaster in Tarn. Each Player should have their Character’s Belief provide a reason for them to sympathize with House Thorn or have animosity towards the factors that threaten it. Being bound by a similar World Belief helps move the story forwards while giving all Characters the opportunity to be true to their concept.

Malik’s World Belief: ***House Thorn is the only power holding order in eastern Tarn, and if it falls many Eskarn will suffer. For the sake of my people I will use my might to defeat the House’s enemies wherever I find them.***

Elaria’s World belief: ***Before he died, the Lord of House Thorn took me in even though I’m his bastard. I owe him my life, and I will defend House Thorn with my guile and my bow to the very end.***

## Other Belief  

The Other Belief pertains directly to another Player’s Character. Pick a Character that interests you as a Player, and think about your Character’s feelings about or towards that Character. You may wish to help or hinder them in some way.

Malik’s Other Belief: ***I loved Elaria’s father as a brother and owed him my life. To pay this debt, I must protect his daughter’s honor and person with my steel as if she were my own.***

This tells us a lot about this Character. It is strongert han the simple expression of a statistic characteristic. We know from this that he is loyal, and imbued with a sense of honor and duty beyond the simple idea that he will protect Elaria. More importantly, it tells the DM and other Players what types of activities his Player wants from the game. He wants to fight to protect others. Ideals of honor and bonds of kinship are important to him.

A strong Belief like this opens up the possibility for exciting interactions between Characters.

Elaria’s Other Belief: ***As I grew to maturity, my adoration of Mailk became something more, but because he is half Eskarn and I am of Noble Tarnish blood, this love can never be. I must act coldly towards him while harboring my secret feelings.***

This belief already strongly colors their interactions and adds potential for future intrigue. When Malik finds out, he may then be conflicted over Elaria’s role as a surrogate daughter or perhaps reciprocate her amorous feelings. Malik’s Player might even be inspired by this narrative avenue and shape his backstory to add fuel to it. He could say that Malik was always in love with Elaria’s mother, whom she very much resembles, but who chose Elaria’s father over him. This is just one of a multitude of engaging interactions made possible by a strong Belief. Perhaps Elaria hates Malik, blaming him for her father’s death, and wants nothing to do with what she views as his attempt at penance. Even though each Player only makes a single Other Belief, they are encouraged when creating their Character to discuss potential shared backstory that may tie them to other Characters. The Other Belief simply represents the strongest or most interesting of these connections that a Player wishes to explore.

## Self Belief  

The Self Belief is the most complex of the three, and is often the most difficult for new Players to craft well. It is a philosophical Belief, tied to one of the Character’s moral or ethical priorities. The most interesting Characters will have this third Belief in some way come into tension with the other two.

> Malik’s Self Belief: ***I am of Eskarn blood, the Inoruit are my kinsmen, and the Tarnish have caused much wrong to my people. I will uphold my bonds of blood and clan before those of gold or fealty.***

> Elaria’s Self Belief: ***I have always resented being a bastard. I can lead the House better than my half brother, and I will use subterfuge to ensure that I sit upon my father’s throne.***

## Complication

Complications are core negative or detrimental facets of a Character's personality. Each Character must start with at least one Complication. A player may invent their own Complication or choose one from the following list.

| d20  |  Complication |
|---|---|
|1|Loner: Your trust is not easily earned. Even those you do trust, you never trust completely. You think everyone should be able to take care of themselves; if they can’t, it’s their own fault. You often have trouble saying thanks.<br><br>This characters suffers from a fundamental lack of trust in others, and will in a crisis seek to keep knowledge to themselves, keep away from others, and trust no one.|
|2|Cowardly: If things are going south, you’re likely to save yourself. Even if you care for your companions, the fear for your own life is greater. Even if you’re a fighter, you’d rather slit a man’s throat than risk a fair fight.<br><br>As things turn against the character, they do not stand fast. Rather, they are prepared to change their convictions, serve those who are stronger, and abandon those who rely upon them.|
|3|Greedy: You cannot resist the temptation of wealth or power. You will do terrible things for gold or valuables, even at great risk. You believe that coins or station can afford you happiness, and you’re willing to pay whatever price it takes to get them.<br><br>By accumulating worldly goods, this character seeks safety and power. When they are overcome by this, their lust for valuables will overtake any rational impulse.|

|5|Arrogant: You are always right. Everyone else is beneath you.

|6|Thieving: You cannot help but take loose coins and precious things that catch your eye. It’s not avarice, it’s that you just have to take it. You steal for the rush; it is compulsive.<br><br>By accumulating worldly goods, this character seeks safety and power. When they are overcome by this, their lust for valuables will overtake any rational impulse.|
|7|Drunk: You’d always like a drink, and a drink always makes you want another. Seldom without cup in hand, or wineskin at your belt, you need to be drinking. It helps you sleep, or forget, or remember.<br><br>This character seeks refuge in earthly pleasure, seeking to dull their minds against pain and sorrow by drunkenness, lechery, or other vices.|
|8|Resentful: You grow bitter at perceived slights. You remember all wrongs against you and allow them to fester in your heart.

|11|Loose Tongued: You often say what you feel even when it is not appropriate. Perhaps you are too clever for your own good, a cynic with a sharp tongue, or an innocent fool oblivious to your blunders.<br><br>Untruths are a way of creating an armour against an unkind world for this character, who will tend to exaggerate and outright lie in order to conceal facts, gain benefits, or just make themselves more interesting.|
|12|Intolerant: You are strongly partial to your own creed and intolerant of others. You favor those who appear similar to you almost as much as you dislike those who do not.<br><br>Some idea or cause provides this character with meaning, and the worse things get, the more they will double down on it and seek to remove all threats to it.|
|13|Fanatic: You have excessive zeal for a particular subject. Perhaps you are extremely religious, or unshakably devoted to a leader or cause. The ends always justify vicious means. Sometimes you do things for your group that they wouldn’t agree with, but you do it for their own good.<br><br>Some idea or cause provides this character with meaning, and the worse things get, the more they will double down on it and seek to remove all threats to it.|

Every death or injury of those around you weighs on your conscience.<br><br>This character withdraws from all emotion and engagement as they get stressed, becoming cold and distant as they seek to take no part in anything.|

Others may not take you seriously, viewing you as puerile or simpleminded, but you simply experience the world in a different way.<br><br>Thinking about things only brings distress and uncertainty, so it’s better to act upon impulses and follow your whims, as this character is wont to do when in danger.|

Any violator of your precepts, no matter how close to you, is not above the code.<br><br>A memorable death is the only true sign of a life well lived, so this character seeks to plunge themselves into worthy danger in order to prove their value.|

# Finishing Touches

You should now have all the information you need to start building a solid player character. You know where your character has lived the majority of their life, the composition of their family, and the important relationships that have helped define them. You also know some of their personality quirks, their fears, and their likes and dislikes. You also may have a character secret. All that’s left is to turn this information into a cohesive story. Take the information you’ve gathered and stitch it all together, interpreting what you need to along the way.

Remember that if a result or two from your rolls doesn't quite work for your character concept, you can ask your Dungeon Master to reroll or disregard the result entirely. And, of course, don’t forget to choose a race and class.

Some questions you might ask yourself  
when trying to decide your character include

- What does the character look like? Does he have any distinctive features, like scars or tattoos? Where did he get them?
- Does the character have a family? Any old friends? People he cares about outside the player characters?
- What does the character love? What does he hate? Does he have any regrets? Is there something that makes his skin crawl?
- Does he have any secrets?
- Is the character rational or passionate? Sophisticated or superstitious? Impulsive or habitual? Logical or faithful?
- What drives the character to adventure? What are his goals and drives? What would he do to accomplish them?
- What is the character’s worst nightmare?
