# Where I’m From
Create a snapshot of where you came from and how it shaped the person you became. Pick details to inspire you and use them to answer the prompts.
### Where Did You Call Home?
For some characters this is a permanent room or residence. For others it is an abstract feeling about certain periods of safety and stability. Finding those truths for your character will help you understand how he or she approaches the concept of home on the road.

>Where did you most often sleep? `________________________`
>What did you need to do to maintain it? `________________________`
>Did it protect you and what you cared for? `________________________`

### Where Did People Socialize?
There are places of merriment and relaxation everywhere. This exercise will examine one of particular importance to your character.

  Choose two:
 - The hearth was always warm when the wind was cold.
 - The music moves your heart even in memory.
 - The owner was wise or at least gave advice as though he were.
 - The food was cooked with quiet pride.
 - It always seemed to hold a dazzling glow.

- Cunning
- Nature
- Wealth
- Ambition
- The divine
- One another
- The law
- Life

  How do your personal values differ?

### Who Was in Charge?
Any collective is under the rule of some other force. Even those who reject rule by other creatures are subject to the will of law or nature. This exercise explores the relationship between your character and authority.

The force in charge of your hometown: (choose two)
- Was a thing of power and majesty
- Never spoke but was always heard

What was the ruler’s name?
Based on this experience, when you picture a ruler, what does he, she, or they look like?
If given the chance to lead, whom would you emulate?

### What Was Your Place?
Perhaps the single thing that most dramatically colors your character’s perception of place of origin is her or his place in it. It is useless to know your character was a student, noble, or blacksmith if you do not understand how he or she feels about it. Finding this will solidify what your character is running away from and toward.

#  What Gets Left Behind
Most people think of adventurers as being larger-than-life heroes, but all heroes come from somewhere. In this exercise, you’re going to explore objects associated with a life you walked away from. Choose details that will help inspire your creativity and answer the prompts to discover the building blocks of your past.

##  Former Flame
This object is related to a former passion. There was once something that moved you the way wealth, glory, or righteousness moves you now.  

Choose two:    
- I could not take this with me on the road.  
- My interest slowly waned over time until  my heart had fully stolen away. 
- I could hold it in my hand and feel pride.
- There were many in my life who smiled when they saw this.
- Even now, I sometimes think of it during wistful nights. 
- This was crafted specifically for me with love. 
- I made this with my own hands.  

Once you understand what this object is, write a scene explaining where it is now. Is it collecting dust? Has it worn out from use? Has it crumbled to discarded ashes?

## Broken Shackle
 Before your life on the road, you suffered a persistent dread that you would end up condemned to a life of unnoticed misery. You were reminded of this fear every time you touched this object.

Roll a d6 or choose:
1.  This was part of a profession you are glad to have escaped.
2.  It was a way for society to punish what it did not understand.
3.  Every detail whispers the dark promise of tedium.
4.  Its delicate features made your strong hands feel ugly and unworthy.
5.  It looked old and broken before you ever touched it and looks much the same now.
6.  This was given to you by someone with love in her eyes and pride in her heart.

Write about the last moment you touched this object.

# Five Lessons
These are five lessons your character learned growing up and in training that helped shape his or her identity as a hero. Answer the  prompts to discover what they are.  

1. Growing up you experienced something that you never wish to revisit. It could be the desperation of extreme poverty, the isolation of social rejection, or even the guilt associated with having done something wrong.  
   What have you learned should be avoided at all costs? What measures do you take these days to avoid this?

2. Before you truly understood your abilities, you unintentionally caused harm with them.
	What did you break or whom did you injure? How did you make up for your mistake? What did this situation teach you about managing your strength? 

4. As an adolescent you stood up against something stronger than you to fight a perceived injustice.
	What did you lose in pursuit of your ideals? How did this event shape your response to wrongdoing as an adult? 

4. When you were a child, someone close to you hid a truth from you. As an adult you realized that person’s deception.  
	How did the lie shape you? Did the truth hurt you? How do you approach deception as an adult? 

5. During your training you risked your life for something and were rewarded for it.
	How close did you come to death? What was the nature of your reward? What do you take into consideration when risking your life these days?

# Five Things You Packed but Shouldn’t Have
Examine your character’s inexperience by examining items that really don’t belong in an adventurer’s pack.

1. Growing up, you were taught that a specific item was important to your identity. On the road you have found little use for it. Every time you see it among your belongings, you make an excuse to keep it, though each time, those excuses are harder to find.
 What is this, and where did you get it?

2. This was part of an old superstition you were taught as a child. It has since proven to be untrue.
  What is it, and when did you try to use it?

3. When first venturing out, you grabbed this. It seemed like something useful you would need on the road. You are still waiting for the perfect opportunity to pull it out.
  What is it, and when do you plan to use it?

4. You purchased this intending to learn how to use it. You keep putting off that learning experience. Now throwing it away would be admitting you will never gain that skill.
  What is it, and how long would it actually take you to learn how to use it?

5. This is an article of clothing for which you have a sentimental fondness. It is damaged to the point of being unusable, or it could be replaced by a more suitable item.
  What is it, and who made it?

# A Touch of Home
Constantly on the road, most adventurers split their time between staying at inns and camping in dangerous places. Even for the most hardened nomads, an inn can feel sterile and cold without some homey touches. Answer the prompts to discover what your character does to make a strange room feel like home.

During the months when the cold stings even indoors, inns tend to skimp on the sheets.
  What do you bring to keep yourself warm?

Although there are hidden gems everywhere, most inns don’t pride themselves on culinary delicacies.
  What do you always keep with you to liven up a bland meal?

Wood, thatch, pitch, and mud—the materials most inns are built from—are warmer than a tent but aren’t exactly pretty.
  What colorful thing cuts through the monotony of most inns?

An evening of carousing often leads to singing and swapping stories.
  What tale or song do you bring to an evening of revelry to warm your homesick heart?

Not every hero gambles his or her treasure, but almost all adventurers play games to pass the time.
  What is your favorite thing to play?

For some adventurers, taking a bath is the ultimate luxury.
  When you’re not scrubbing away the dirt of the road, how do you make the most of the experience?

# Five Fears
The true measure of courage is not to face danger fearlessly but to face fear and overcome it. Heroes without fear lack an important emotional tool to add weight to their stories. This exercise will help you discover that fear makes you stronger and more interesting.

## The Body
One of the most obvious fears to confront an adventurer with is that of physical harm. After all, a huge portion of the job is risking danger. Pain and death are obvious and appropriate fears that most adventurers will face often. It may add flavor to some characters to make this a fear of specific injury: for instance, a bard may be terrified of an injured hand, which will affect her music. Some characters may need an even subtler approach. A strong fighter may fear their body aging, thus losing their defining trait. A character obsessed with strength can even fear an inadequacy that does not exist, frightened of a weakness she does not possess.

  Carefully consider what your character feels is important and what he or she would do to protect that. For instance:
- Pain
-  Weakness
-  Inadequacy
-  Injury
-  Sickness
-  Death

## The Mind
The most powerful tool any adventurer has in her arsenal is her mind, since it controls how she puts her skills to use. It can also work against her, constructing invisible enemies and threats out of harmless things. Shadows can be signs of lurking horror; coincidence can be a sign of a superior enemy; an oddly phrased sentence can be a sign of conspiracy. Adventurers make calculations about danger out of necessity. Fear lies in how they draw those conclusions and react to them. The mind is also the space where characters catalog their plans and resources. Any anxiety about failure, readiness, or progress is felt through the mind. Certain heroes are dependent on their minds in ways others are not. For a wizard, his mind and ability to study are paths to power. It is easy to tie this story to fears of inadequacy and anxiety over sense of self. Fears of the mind are less visceral than others, but they carry no less weight.

  To create a mind-based fear for your character, consider what you know and focus on the dangers you find most important. For instance:
-  Anxiety
-  Lack of preparation
-  Feeling lost
-  Post-traumatic stress
-  Lack of valuable information
-  Existential dread

## The Soul
The world of fantasy offers boundless possibilities for exploring spiritual themes. A lot of what is abstract in real life takes concrete form in fantasy. It is very possible to play a character who simply fears evil as a force. A story about good and evil on a conceptual level becomes more grounded when you have a character embody those concepts. Evil is very easy to understand when it can swing a sword at you. You can even create internal conflict by exploring the thought process of a good person for whom violence is an unavoidable aspect of life. Fearing personal corruption is a great way to add weight to actions and decisions your character must make.

  To construct a spiritual fear, ask difficult questions about your character’s beliefs and behavior. Create an emotional attachment to his or her sense of justice and find the areas where there are no easy answers. For instance:
-  The nature of evil
-  The fragility of virtue
-  A specific evil person
-  Personal corruption
-  Crisis of faith
-  Cosmic horror à la H.P. Lovecraft

## The Heart
Emotional storytelling is the core of character-driven fiction. The way you interact with other characters drives a great deal of the story. Rejection is an easy theme around which to build fear. Our world is already fraught with social strife surrounding appearance and acceptance. Adding features like tusks, tails, and otherworldly fire to other characters or NPCs (non-player characters) makes differences more overt and easier to play with. Facing rejection is especially terrifying when one’s way of life depends on trusting other people. On the other side of the coin, intimacy is another common heroic fear. Allowing yourself to care about others makes the pain of loss more pronounced and opens you up to new vulnerabilities. Fear of intimacy raises the stakes on otherwise mundane interactions.

  To construct a fear of the heart, focus on a social interaction and what would happen if something went wrong. For instance:
-  Rejection
-  Intimacy
-  Loneliness
-  Personal awkwardness
-  Loss
-  Social pressures to succeed

## The Beast
Despite being abstract, the beast is probably the most commonly represented fear in storytelling. It is based around the unknown and unknowable causing harm. The most obvious manifestation of the beast is monsters: the awful things that lurk in dungeons with sharp teeth and steely claws. It is easy to play a character who fears a specific type of monster. Almost every creature found in amonster manual, or bestiary, is individually terrifying, and it is easy to empathize with a character who sees monsters that way. The beast is also a central aspect of cosmic horror, where forbidden truths unravel stable aspects of reality to make our world unstable and unsafe. There is also an element of the beast in the fears that drive hatred and bigotry. Those who are ignorant and fear what they do not understand are in thrall to the beast.

  To construct a fear of the beast, think of what your character does not know and find a way to make that dangerous. Focus on the alien and outwardly horrific to find the shape of the beast. For instance:
-  Monstrous appearance
-  Dangerous abilities
-  Forbidden knowledge
-  Alien cultures and practices
-  Unfamiliar devices
-  Uncontained power
