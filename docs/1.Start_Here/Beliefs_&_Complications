## Beliefs

Characters are defined by their Beliefs, the fundamental ideas that drive them. Beliefs represent a Character’s explicit outlook and their Player’s goals.  They help solidify what kind of Character their Player wants them to be, what they want to do, and how they are tied to the Premise of the Campaign and the other Characters. Beliefs let the Arbiter and other Players know what you as a Player want out of the Campaign, and help you to tell a better story together. Consider the types of activities you want to experience.

#### Sample Activities:

- Skillful fighting
- Diplomatic negotiations
- Experimenting with alchemy
- Amassing a huge fortune
- Becoming a folk hero
- Pursuing romance
- Exploring the world
- Mastering swordsmanship
- Rising to power
- Seeking revenge
- Unraveling mysteries
- Defending the weak
- Making reckless choices
- Being a leader
- Acting as a skillful tactician

Beliefs are meant to be challenged. They can grow stronger or weaker, be shattered, and even betrayed.  They can change as Characters grow and develop over the course of a Campaign, or remain the solid bastions that define a Character's journey.

Any time a Character gains a level, they may alter one or more Beliefs. Altering Beliefs is not mandatory; rather, it should be done rarely and only when a large shift occurs in a Character or the narrative.

A strong Belief is a compounded Ideology and Action. They are unambiguous and have no verbal nuance. Try the following formulas:
**I think A, so I’ll do B.**
**Because of A, I want B, so I’ll do C.**

***My family is weak, and I must lead it if it is to prosper, so I must earn the favor of the Lord Thorn to ensure my position at its head.****
This Belief combines an “Idea” (My family is weak.) With “What” the Character will do about it (I must lead it if it is to prosper.) And “How” the Character intends to do it (I must earn the favor of the Lord Thorn.)

Each Player should make one Belief about some aspect of the Premise of the Campaign (World Belief),one about another Player’s Character (Other Belief),and one your Character has about themselves (Self Belief).

##  World Belief  

The World Belief directly connects your Character to a key part of the Premise of the Campaign and their goals regarding it. It could relate to a Character, a faction, impending conflict, recent disaster, or any other force requiring immediate action. Pick something that interests you as a Player, and think about your Character's opinion on it. How do they view it and feel about it? Consider how they will act based on this opinion, and what has prevented them from doing so already, or what stands in their way now. The DM may want to use this Belief to unite the Players under a common cause. Using our previous example, they might say the Campaign is about an impending disaster in Tarn. Each Player should have their Character’s Belief provide a reason for them to sympathize with House Thorn or have animosity towards the factors that threaten it. Being bound by a similar World Belief helps move the story forwards while giving all Characters the opportunity to be true to their concept.

Malik’s World Belief: ***House Thorn is the only power holding order in eastern Tarn, and if it falls many Eskarn will suffer. For the sake of my people I will use my might to defeat the House’s enemies wherever I find them.***

Elaria’s World belief: ***Before he died, the Lord of House Thorn took me in even though I’m his bastard. I owe him my life, and I will defend House Thorn with my guile and my bow to the very end.***

## Other Belief  

The Other Belief pertains directly to another Player’s Character. Pick a Character that interests you as a Player, and think about your Character’s feelings about or towards that Character. You may wish to help or hinder them in some way.

Malik’s Other Belief: ***I loved Elaria’s father as a brother and owed him my life. To pay this debt, I must protect his daughter’s honor and person with my steel as if she were my own.***

This tells us a lot about this Character. It is strongert han the simple expression of a statistic characteristic. We know from this that he is loyal, and imbued with a sense of honor and duty beyond the simple idea that he will protect Elaria. More importantly, it tells the DM and other Players what types of activities his Player wants from the game. He wants to fight to protect others. Ideals of honor and bonds of kinship are important to him.

A strong Belief like this opens up the possibility for exciting interactions between Characters.

Elaria’s Other Belief: ***As I grew to maturity, my adoration of Mailk became something more, but because he is half Eskarn and I am of Noble Tarnish blood, this love can never be. I must act coldly towards him while harboring my secret feelings.***

This belief already strongly colors their interactions and adds potential for future intrigue. When Malik finds out, he may then be conflicted over Elaria’s role as a surrogate daughter or perhaps reciprocate her amorous feelings. Malik’s Player might even be inspired by this narrative avenue and shape his backstory to add fuel to it. He could say that Malik was always in love with Elaria’s mother, whom she very much resembles, but who chose Elaria’s father over him. This is just one of a multitude of engaging interactions made possible by a strong Belief. Perhaps Elaria hates Malik, blaming him for her father’s death, and wants nothing to do with what she views as his attempt at penance. Even though each Player only makes a single Other Belief, they are encouraged when creating their Character to discuss potential shared backstory that may tie them to other Characters. The Other Belief simply represents the strongest or most interesting of these connections that a Player wishes to explore.

## Self Belief  

The Self Belief is the most complex of the three, and is often the most difficult for new Players to craft well. It is a philosophical Belief, tied to one of the Character’s moral or ethical priorities. The most interesting Characters will have this third Belief in some way come into tension with the other two.

> Malik’s Self Belief: ***I am of Eskarn blood, the Inoruit are my kinsmen, and the Tarnish have caused much wrong to my people. I will uphold my bonds of blood and clan before those of gold or fealty.***

> Elaria’s Self Belief: ***I have always resented being a bastard. I can lead the House better than my half brother, and I will use subterfuge to ensure that I sit upon my father’s throne.***

## Complication

Complications are core negative or detrimental facets of a Character's personality. Each Character must start with at least one Complication. A player may invent their own Complication or choose one from the following list.
