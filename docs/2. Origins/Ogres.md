OGRES ARE SOLITARY and odd creatures that come wandering out of the depths of Davokar, fully grown but devoid of memories and with no sense of identity. It is up to the humans or goblins who eventually take them in to give them a name and teach them the ways of the world.

The tales told of ogres vary from being hilarious to horrific. What is known is that the witches of Davokar sometimes take ogres under their wing and raise them to be guards and servants. Explorers have also reported that an Ambrian outpost near the Black Pitch Mire has adopted an ogre called Armstout and the soldiers there have the giant dig ditches, lift heavy equipment and draw the plow from time to time. A similar phenomenon is the ogres that are snatched by goblin gangs in the slums of Yndaros to serve as heavy-­handed enforcers.

In southern Davokar they tell of the companions Deterror and Vitrona, the latter a skillful scout employed by the witches and the former a huge ogre and the scout’s best friend. Word of the duo has also reached Thistle Hold where they have become the subjects of a series of popular songs, supposedly recounting their adventures in the ruins of Symbaroum.

OGRE TRAITS

Though they do not realize it, all ogres share a common origin and have many more similarities than differences despite their varied upbringings.

- Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 2. Increase any other ability score by 1.
- Age. Ogres have no sense of their ‘birth’ and it is up to other people to keep track of their age in whatever way they see fit. The general consensus is that ogres can live for several decades at least, and at least one ogre is known to have reached 100 years of service to the witches, plus however many years spent wandering in the wild before that.
- Size. Ogres tend to be from 7 to 8 feet tall and weigh from 250 to 350 pounds. Your size is Medium and you have a d8 Hit Die. At first level you have 9 hit points plus your Constitution modifier. When you gain a level in any class, you gain an additional Hit Die and 6 (1d8) plus your Constitution modifier hit points (see below).
- Speed. Ogres have long limbs and an incautious attitude, your base speed is 40 feet.
- Darkvision. Accustomed to the gloom of Davokar, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light as if it were normal light. In complete darkness, you rely on your other senses to give you blindsight within 10 feet. You never receive disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks due to darkness.
- Pariahs. Ogres are often poorly treated in society and have disadvantage on Charisma checks with other peoples. However, they tend to do well with goblins and make normal Charisma checks when interacting with them.
- Calmness. Ogres are slow to speak, slow to take offense and are possessed by a deep mental placidity. You have advantage on Wisdom saving throws against enchantments and other mind-­altering magics.
- Tough Skin. Ogres can withstand more hurt than most other creatures. At first level you gain an additional hit point. When rolling for hit points, roll the Hit Die twice and use the higher result. If using the average result, use 6.
- Languages. Ogres speak the language of whomever adopted them.

OGRE NAMES

Ogres seem to lack any given names and are therefore nicknamed by people around them. These nicknames often allude to the ogres’ size or the taciturn calm that many mistake for stupidity. Ordo Magica speculates that such lonesome creatures actually have no use for proper names – the ogre knows who it is and that is enough.

- Ogre names: Bauta, Ugly, Angry, Odd, Gawky, Heavy, Big Brute, Roughneck, Freak, Oaf, Ox, Rageor.

Ogre Backgrounds

The following backgrounds represent three of the most common outcomes for a newly discovered ogre.

Learned in Magic

You were discovered or brought to a group of mystics, most often the witches of Davokar or Ordo Magica or possibly a troll singer. You made careful and quiet study of the techniques you were taught and have proven yourself to your instructors and are now ready to prove yourself again to the world.

- Skill Proficiencies: Arcana
- Tool Proficiencies (choose one): Any musical instrument
- Equipment: An instrument to match your proficiency, tattered clothes and 1d4 + 1 shillings.

Feature: Spellbound

Ogres usually have a little bit of their own magic about them and those that study the magical arts gain a resistance to force damage.

Suggested Characteristics

You are naturally attracted to the forces of magic and feel like it is almost a personal concern for yourself. However, it is difficult to give voice to these feelings, especially as everything seems at once new and old to you…

Raised by Common Folk

You were discovered by the average folk of a village, town or other community. Noted for your large size and endurance you were soon put to work. In exchange, you are fed, allowed to sleep in a shed and sometimes, just sometimes, allowed to listen in as a teacher instructs the children of the neighborhood or an expert passes on their trade to junior workers.

- Skill Proficiencies: Athletics
- Tool Proficiencies (choose One): Carpenter’s tools, mason’s tools or smith’s tools
- Equipment: A kit to match your tool proficiency, thick working clothes and 3d6 + 2 shillings.

Feature: Unending Labors

You don’t tire as easily as the humans and you recover faster. When you take a long rest and have some food and drink you reduce your exhaustion level by 2.

Suggested Characteristics

You were accepted by the sort of people who usually scream, run and hide from ogres. That warms your heart and gives you a bit of hope that you might have more in common with other peoples than it would first seem.

Sellsword

You were pressed into service as a warrior almost as soon as you were discovered. The people who found you might have had good intentions and you might have defended a village or patrolled a patch of roadway. But more likely the folks you fell in with were robbers and thieves and you were taught that might made right, and your might helped make them right more often than not.

- Skill Proficiencies (choose one): Athletics, Acrobatics, Deception or Intimidation
- Tool Proficiencies (choose one): Carpenter’s Tools or Mason’s Tools
- Equipment: A kit to match your tool proficiency, thick working clothes and 1d6 + 4 shillings.

Feature: Routine Punishment

You have been in many scrapes over the years and lost your share of conflicts, but you you always got back up, every time. You have advantage on your first death saving throw. You must complete a short or longer rest before using this feature again.

Suggested Characteristics

You haven’t known any other life than that of a mercenary. You might feel that you have done nothing but good with your weapons, but there’s still some hint in the back of your mind that you were meant for something more than just killing people (even if you are really good at it).
