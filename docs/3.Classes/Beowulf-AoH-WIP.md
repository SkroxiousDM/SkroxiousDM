Wyrd
Due to the influence of their fated destiny, a Hero can use an
alignment die. The die used is dependent on the hero’s alignment.
At the start of a session, a Neutral character can choose between
using the Church die and the Old Gods die.
Alignment Die. Before you roll with advantage, choose one of the
d20s to be your alignment die. If you select that die as the result
you gain inspiration.
For more detail, see Using the Alignment Die on page 28.
Heroic Tale
When creating your character you choose a heroic tale that
represents the ability score your Hero most strongly represents. The
tale you choose grants you features at 1st level and again at 3rd, 7th,
10th, 14th, and 18th level.
Fighting Style
At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty.
Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting
Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.
Desperate Duelling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other
weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
GreatWeaponWielding
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make
with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can
reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1
or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property
for you to gain this benefit.
Shield-Strong
When you are equipped with a spear in one hand and a shield in
the other, you gain an additional +1 bonus to AC.
Hammer-Handed
When you take the attack action and have at least one hand free,
you may make an unarmed or improvised weapon strike as a bonus
action.
Mighty Mettle
Also when you reach 2nd level you can spend a bonus action,
inspiration, and one or more Hit Dice to grant yourself temporary
hit points. You receive hit points equal to your level in this class plus
the total rolled on the Hit Dice. You do not add your Constitution
modifier when using Hit Dice in this manner.
Ability Score Improvement or Feat
When you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and
19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or
you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal,
you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
Instead of raising ability scores directly, you can instead select a
feat, see page 77. Most feats raise one specified attribute by 1 in
addition to their other features.
Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once,
whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
Indomitable
At 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so,
you must use the new roll, and you can’t use this feature again until
you finish a long rest.

melee weapon attack against you and misses, as a reaction you may
make a single melee weapon attack against that creature.
Relentless
Beginning at 15th level you can keep fighting despite grievous
wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points and don’t die outright, you can

make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you
drop to 1 hit point instead. Each time you use this feature after
the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long
rest, the DC resets to 10.
Ferocious Onslaught
Starting at 17th level, as a bonus action you may spend inspiration
to make a powerful attack with a melee weapon. If the blow hits
your weapon shatters, destroying the weapon, and it does an extra
2d8 damage, plus another 1d8 for each gift your weapon has (if
any), and it is an automatic critical hit.
When you do damage using this feature you gain a level of
exhaustion, and must take a long rest before using it again.
Hero’s Doom
At 20th level you can use your bonus action to nominate one
creature. It loses the undefeatable condition if it has it. If your
hit points are equal to or above one quarter of your maximum hit
points, reduce your hit points to one quarter of your maximum.

Heroes come in many different shapes and sizes, and their
heroism takes different forms. Heroes choose one Tale to follow.
Each Tale is based on an attribute score.

hands, the creature must succeed at a Constitution saving

the near future, whether you find them through the study of
animal bones, the patterns of living animals, or simple quiet
contemplation. You describe a potential course of action to the

thinking. Whether very attractive to the eye, simply delightfully
charming, or extremely forceful in will, this kind of Hero has no
problem in gathering others to their cause.

Glamour
When you choose this tale at 1st level, strangers are easily awed
by you. If you spend inspiration on your first Charisma check
with a stranger, success will produce a dramatic or improbable
result. What this means is up to your GM, but examples might
be a guard defying orders to let you pass, a hostile enemy backing
down from a fight, or a suspicious chieftain suddenly taking you
into their confidence.

Heroic Presence
Beginning at 3rd level, when another creature within 30
feet of you that can see you makes an ability check,

inspiration to try to dispel a magical effect on
another creature. Make a Charisma (Intimidation
or Persuasion, your choice) check versus a DC equal

saving throw, use 10 plus the spell slot level used, or the

a success, the creature is freed from the effect. After using
this ability you must take a short or long rest before using
it again.

Peacemaker
Starting at 14th level, as an action you may attempt
to halt a combat. Each creature within 60 feet who can
hear and understand you must make a Wisdom saving
throw, with a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Charisma modifier. A creature that fails the save takes the
Dodge action on its turn. At the beginning of your next turn if
no one has made an attack roll since your last turn the combat
ends and you can speak for up to one minute. Afterwards, the
combat might resume, depending on the GM’s ruling. You must
take a short or long rest before using this feature again.

Instill Doubt
At 18th level you can spend a bonus action to give a creature the
following feature:
Defeatable. This creature gains the defeated condition if you use
your action and succeed at a Charisma (Intimidation) check with
the DC equal to 20 plus twice the creature’s Charisma modifier
and the creature’s current hit point total is lower than yours.
You must take a long rest before using this feature again.

# HEROIC FEATS
A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides.

At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat’s description says otherwise.

You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat’s prerequisite, you can’t use that feat until you regain the prerequisite.

Improve your Wisdom score by 1. You know some of the secret
words of the universe that can give creatures new strength. You
have a healing pool equal to your proficiency bonus plus your
Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1 point).
You can spend a bonus action and 1 or more points from your

Chapter 1: Passions and Dreadful Insights
Have you ever watched a horror movie and were boggled at a character’s obliviousness? On a dark and stormy night,
with creepy shadows lurking about, our main character insists on sticking their head into a darkened closet or tramping
down into the bloodstained basement with only a flickering candle.
Characters in horror games are driven by their passions, rather than cold, analytical thinking. A determined investigator
plunges into the ghost-haunted graveyard, willing to risk anything to prove that the supernatural exists. A hardened
warrior coats their spearhead in molten silver, caring little if they survive an encounter with a werewolf so long as they
have the chance to avenge their lost family.
A Passion is a belief that shapes your character’s actions. It might send you into a dangerous situation, but it also offers
benefits that help offset the peril it causes.
A Insight is a revelation about the horrors in the world that leaves your beliefs shaken and your concept of reality
changed in some way. Some cosmic horrors, through their mere existence, grant insights into reality that many folk
would prefer to do without. When you gain a Insight, it forces you to confront the nature of reality and your irrelevant
place in it.
Overview
During the game, you might face a situation where your Passion can push you into danger. You can act according to the
Passion or try to resist it. Acting with your Passion grants you a benefit, even if it puts you into danger. Resisting it might
allow you to dodge trouble, but it comes at a cost.
Gaining Passions
You start play with one Passion of your choice. You can create a Passion or use one of the example ones provided
below.
Creating a Passion
A good passion should drive you into action. Here are some guidelines to consider when brainstorming a passion.
A Passion Demands Action
A passion must push you to do things, rather than force you into inaction. When a passion urges you to act, it should
move you forward into danger rather than push you into a passive stance.
A Passion Needs External Triggers
If you can always control when a passion comes into play, it lacks the ability to drive your actions. A good passion has
an external source, one that draws you forward into the game.
A Passion Has an Element of Risk
The best passions for gaming have the potential to destroy you if you take them too far. Push too deep into secrets, and
you risk falling prey to dark forces. A passion should push you toward risks, rather than encourage careful, calculating
moves.
Using Passions
There are two ways to use Passions.
Invoking a Passion
When you make a d20 Test, you can add a +5 bonus to the roll if the GM agrees that the roll is directly related to your
Passion and what it means to you. You choose to do this before rolling. Once you use any Passion in this way, you
cannot gain this benefit again until you embrace your passion, as described below.
Following a Passion
During the game, the GM can challenge you to follow a Passion. When you face a choice, the GM can present a course
of action that aligns with one of your Passions. You have two choices.
Embrace Your Passion. You follow the GM’s suggestion or offer an alternative that they agree matches your Passion. In
return, you gain Heroic Inspiration and Temporary Hit Points equal to 5 + your level.
“Nothing great in the world has ever been accomplished without passion.”
- Hegel
Deny Your Passion. Alternatively, you can attempt to resist your passion. Roll a d20. If the result is 10 or higher, you
resist your passion and can act as you wish. If you roll 9 or lower, your conflict with your Passion shakes you. You
cannot gain or use Heroic Inspiration until you finish a Long Rest.
Losing and Replacing a Passion
You can replace a Passion with a new one of your choice when it has been resolved. If a Passion drives you to expose a
corrupt priest, it is no longer relevant when you have slain the priest or brought their crimes to light. You might also
decide that a Passion is no longer relevant to the campaign or your character’s interests. You might swear vengeance
against a foe who wronged you, or a crisis might turn your beliefs upside down.
You should create your new Passion in collaboration with your GM. You can select one based on events of the campaign
or how your character might evolve after bringing their passion to an end.
Example Passions
This section includes a variety of Passions you can use as models for your own creations. A set of tables organized by
alignment – a good starting point for your Passion – allows you to randomize your choice. You can roll once for each
aspect of your alignment and pick one. If you are True Neutral, pick a table to roll on at random.

Arcane Hunger
You crave arcane power. Where others see lines that should not be crossed, you see an invitation to plunge into
unknown territory where great insights and power await. You care nothing for social niceties and tradition when it
comes to gaining power. Anything, even your life, is worth risking to uncover the innerworkings of the arcane.
Devoted Faith
You are an ardent support of a deity, to the point that your deity’s ethos overrides almost every other concern you face. If
you had to choose between your own safety, or even your own life, and your deity’s dictates, you might very well make
the ultimate sacrifice rather than give an inch. If you select this Passion, be sure to talk to your GM about the deities in
the campaign and which ones might be a good match for your character.
Hatred
You have a deep, overwhelming hatred for a person, faction, creature, or deity. You act against your own self-interest at
times to lash out at it. You’d die happy knowing that you gave your life to destroy the object of your hatred. Check with
your DM to find a figure our group in your campaign that is a good match for this Passion.
Haunted
You have vague memories of a strange event that happened to you many years ago. The memory is a blur, a
kaleidoscope of impressions, sounds, and images, but nothing concrete. Yet sometimes you come across a person, a
place, a sound, or even a scent that tugs at that memory, compelling you to investigate and solve this strange mystery
that has lingered in your mind.
Heroic Impulse
You are driven by a deep selflessness, one that pushes you to confront evil in any form. Unfortunately, your sense of
self-preservation rarely factors into your thinking. You tend to dive into danger without thinking of the consequences,
leaving you in situations that are over your head.
Insatiable Curiosity
You are driven to uncover secrets, regardless of the danger it might pose to yourself. The thought of lore or information
that exists outside of your awareness can drive you to distraction. You have a bad habit of listening in on conversations
and poking into places that others warn you away from.
Justice for All
You can’t abide bullies, tyrants, or those who use power to abuse others. When you witness the misuse of power, you
can’t help but take a stand against it. You have been known to trade the thrill of punching a town guard in the face for a
two week stint in the baron’s dungeon. In your mind, that moment was worth it.
Loyalty
You are loyal to a group, a nation, or an ideal, gladly putting its own interests above your all regardless of the cost. You
are willing to risk your life and limb to advance the cause. Its needs stand above you in almost every situation. If you
choose this Passion, be sure to talk to your DM about factions, people, or causes in the campaign that fit with your
character.
Seeker of Forbidden Truths
The world is far more dangerous than anyone lets us know. Temples lie to us. Wizards think they understand how magic
works, but it’s all a stack of comforting lies. You are driven to expose the fraud that is the current religious and arcane
traditions. You seek out strange magic, weird creatures, and bizarre situations to prove your theories correct.
Skeptical To a Fault
The mythos? Clearly a folktale, the deranged ravings of a mind saddled crippled by illness. The world and its secrets
have been laid bare by the teachings of the gods and the traditions of arcane magic. When you find signs of strange
phenomena, you are compelled to investigate and dispel any nonsense about it.
Survivor’s Guilt
You survived a terrible incident, one that has haunted you ever since. Above all else, you remember the terrible fate that
befell your friends or loved ones in that incident. Since then, you have been driven a near self-destructive urge to ensure
that such a disaster never happens again.
Thirst for Vengeance
Someone or something wronged you. You are driven to even the score and are willing to accept any cost to yourself to
do so. Your focus sometimes gives you tunnel vision, leading you to disregard all other concerns to smash your
enemies.
Wealth at Any Cost
You want wealth. You’ve seen the power and comfort that comes from amassing a fortune, and you want that for
yourself more than anything else in the world. Offers of riches and plunder tug at your mind, making it difficult for you to
resist them.
Dreadful Insights
A Dreadful Insight is a Passion you gain based on your experiences with the Cthulhu mythos. At their core, the creatures
of the Mythos show that the universe is a vast, uncaring place. Mortals are an accidental byproduct of a cosmic cycle
that they are irrelevant to. Seeing that firsthand can shake your grip on reality and leave you with deep emotional scars.
Gaining a Dreadful Insight
Some creatures or events risk giving you a Dreadful Insight. Typically, you must make a Wisdom saving throw to resist
fully understanding the Insight you might gain. If you succeed the save, your willpower holds and you are able to create
a comforting explanation for what you witnessed. If you fail, you gain a Dreadful Insight, a new Passion that shapes how
you act. The underlying truth of the Mythos pushes into your mind and brings the full weight of the Mythos to bear on
you.
Using a Dreadful Insight
A Dreadful Insight works just like any other Passion, except it tends to pull you along a self-destructive path. You might
become fascinated with a Mythos entity and compelled to encounter it, or you might become obsessed with a tome of
ancient knowledge and driven to master its secrets at any cost.
Losing a Dreadful Insight
Each Dreadful Insight also describes how to lose it. In most cases, you must take actions that resolve the intellectual
and emotional turmoil that the Insight provokes in you. You might need to defeat a creature that created the Insight,
undo the damage caused by the mythos in the world, or prove to yourself that you matter in an uncaring cosmos.
Once you lose a Dreadful Insight in this manner, you can’t gain it again. You have overcome the Insight and are at peace
with it.
