# Captain
	“War is not just won with soldiers, war is won in the planning tent and with leaders on the field.”
	– Field Marshal Beremo Herengol.

THE CAPTAIN CLASS provides the battlefield leaders that were so important in the defeat of the Dark Lords. They are expected to lead both on the battlefield and off it, so they possess both personal martial prowess combined with a capability to command and train others to improve the fighting ability of a group as a whole.
#### CAPTAINS AND ORIGINS
Most captains are found among humans, especially the Ambrian nobility. Barbarian tactics are usually more direct, but they sometimes produce a chieftain that values long-­term thinking and strategy. Sometimes, exceptional ogres can become captains, focusing less on complex tactics and instead using ‘lead from the front’ tactics. Changelings are rarely trusted enough to serve as captains and the few goblin captains that exist tend to focus on leading goblin raiding parties rather than adventuring groups.
#### CAPTAIN SHADOWS
The Shadows of young captains can glow like their burnished armor shining in the noon-­day sun. But for those captains who have experienced battle and sent forth warriors on impossible missions, knowing that their deaths were part of a larger plan, they have darker spots where their soul no longer shines and they might begin to coalesce into darkness as a captain realizes the futility of struggling against the world itself.

- Hit Points at 1st Level: If you do not use your origin to determine hit points, you have 8 + your Constitution modifier.

- (a) chain shirt or (b) studded leather armor, longbow, and 20 arrows
- (a) a martial weapon and a shield or (b) two martial weapons
- (a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) two handaxes
- (a) a dungeoneer’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack
### APPROACH
At 1st level you also choose your approach as a leader of others. Are you a merchant master with a keen eye for prowess as well as profit? A veteran officer of the Queen’s army? An outlaw that leads others in schemes and skulduggery? Or a poet-­warrior, equally skilled with words and weapons?

Your approach gives you benefits at 1st, 2nd, 3rd,  5th, 7th and 9th levels.

### FIGHTING STYLE
You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.
##### Archery
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.
##### Defense
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
##### Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
##### Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-­handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.
##### Polearm Fighting
When wielding a reach weapon, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on a melee attack roll within your reach.
##### Shield Fighting
If you make a successful melee attack roll you can use your bonus action to slam a target within 5 ft with your shield. If the target is your size or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw against 10 plus your Strength (Athletics) modifier. On a failure you can choose to move the creature 10 feet in a line, or cause it to become prone.
##### Snare Fighting
If using a weapon with the ensnaring property and you make a successful attack roll, you can spend a bonus action to forgo doing damage, instead tripping the target and causing it to fall prone. This only works on creatures your size or smaller with two or less legs, or similarly shaped targets.
##### Two-Weapon Fighting
When you engage in two-­weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.
##### new fighting style: Mounted  
You are considered trained in mounted combat. You can also force a single attack roll targeted at your mount to target you instead.

### TACTICAL ACUMEN
You are often more concerned with your group’s readiness at the expense of your own. When combat begins and you are not surprised you can take disadvantage on your initiative roll in order to give advantage on initiative rolls to a number of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus.

### FIELD DRESSINGS
Starting at 1st level, you can help wounded allies during a short or long rest. If you or any friendly creatures regain hit points at the end of the rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.

The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 5th level, to 1d10 at 7th level, and to 1d12 at 9th level.

### BID TO ACTION
Beginning at 2nd level, you can spur others to act quickly. When a creature’s turn ends, use your reaction to nominate a friendly creature to have its turn next instead of acting on its normal initiative count. The creature must not have already taken its turn yet this round and retains its original initiative count for future rounds.

### ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT OR FEAT
When you reach 2nd level, and again at 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 10th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Instead of improving your ability scores you can instead choose to gain a feat. See  Classes and Feats}for more about feats.

### EXTRA ATTACK
Beginning at 3rd level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 18th level in this class.

### Iron Determination
Spend a Recovery Die as an action to temporarily ignore a condition. The amount you roll on the die is how many rounds you can ignore the condition’s effects. This applies only to the following conditions: charmed, frightened, paralyzed, or exhaustion. During this time, you do not continue to roll saving throws to end the effect. Once the benefit ends, the condition resumes.

### WAR STORIES
Beginning at 4th level, you can tell encouraging stories to steel the resolve of your companions. You may restore a number of Hit Dice equal to your proficiency bonus to each friendly creature you share a short or long rest with. Once you use this feature you must take an extended rest before using it again.

At 8th level, you can use this feature twice before needing to take an extended rest.

### UNENDING CONFLICT
At 10th level, when you roll initiative, you gain 1d10 + 10 temporary hit points.

# Captain Approaches
Each captain is a superb leader of others but their goals may be as unique as their personalities. When you choose an approach, you make a choice about what kind of leader you are and what benefits you offer those who follow you.

## Officer
You grew up in or around the military. You might have been one of the children in the baggage train that every army accumulates with no sure knowledge of your parents (or at least your father’s identity), or you might have waited at your parents’ estate for any news from the front lines. As soon as you were able, you joined the battle and learned even more then.

But now the war is over and most soldiers, even Officers, have been dismissed. You might find a sort of similar satisfaction in watching over a misfit group of adventurers, drilling them into something resembling a squad of your soldiers.

### Army Brat
Gain proficiency in the Medicine, Nature or Survival skill. You also gain proficiency with siege weapons. Finally, you gain proficiency with a gaming set of your choice.

### Squad Orders
At 2nd level you can spend time training your fellow adventurers to work together during combat. Choose a number of other characters equal to 1 plus your Charisma modifier to join your squad (when your Charisma modifier increases you can increase the size of your squad). You are automatically a member of the squad and do not count towards the total.

When you roll initiative you can give the squad one of the following orders:
- “Be alert!” Each member of the squad has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made in combat.
- “Brace yourselves!” If the member does not move on their turn, any melee attacks against them are at disadvantage until the beginning of their next turn.
- “Stand fast!” Each member of the squad has advantage on saving throws or ability checks to resist movement effects.

The command is the same for all squad members and the effect of the command lasts for 1 minute.

### Aura of Aggression
When you reach 3rd level you are able to motivate others just by being present. You can activate this aura by using your bonus action on your turn and shouting some choice invectives to spur your allies into being exceedingly aggressive against your enemies. On their next turn, a character that can hear and see you can spend their bonus action to make an additional single melee attack roll against a target within 5 feet.

You can do this a number of times up to your proficiency bonus and then must take a short or longer rest before using this feature again.

### Additional Orders
At 5th level you train your squad to execute some new orders:
- “Braced fire!” At the start of their turn, a member of the squad can use their bonus action to reduce their speed to 0 to gain advantage on their first attack roll with a ranged weapon.
- “Form ranks!” If a member of the squad is within 5 feet of another squad member when they take the Attack action with a melee weapon then the member has advantage on their first attack roll.
- “Stay focused!” Each member of the squad has advantage on saving throws against becoming charmed.

The command is the same for all squad members and the effect of the command lasts for 1 minute.

### Aura of Confidence
At 7th level you and any ally within 30 feet of you are immune to the frightened condition.

### Unwavering
At 9th level, your commitment in battle is unparalleled. If you are reduced to 0 hit points, make a Constitution saving throw (DC 10 or half the damage done, whichever is higher). On a success you are reduced to 1 hit point instead. You must take a long or extended rest before using this feature again.

## Outlaw
Not every captain fights on behalf of their higher-­ups. An Outlaw has broken free from their society and now disobeys its laws. Human Outlaws, either from the barbarians or Ambrians, are often concerned with those their society has left behind. Others, like elves or dwarves may have strained at their limitations and decided on plotting their own way forward. Outlaws focus on stealth and ranged weaponry to even the odds and remain free.

### Hard to Find
You tend to avoid people, especially those associated with authority. Gain proficiency in your choice of Deception, Stealth or Survival.

### Secret Signs
You have taught some of your companions (a number equal to your proficiency bonus) how to communicate by using subtle gestures and movements of the body. This secret language invented by you can only communicate basic concepts but during your turn you can use your bonus action to discreetly signal one of your companions.

### Fleet-­footed
At 2nd level you become very light on your feet and are accustomed to running very quickly. Your base speed increases by 10 feet.

### Eagle’s Eye
At 3rd level, you can use your reaction to give yourself or a friendly creature within 30 feet of you advantage on a ranged weapon attack, as long as they can see and hear you.

### Natural Leader of the Common Folk
Also at 3rd level, you have advantage on any Charisma checks as long as half or more of the people who can hear you are non-­noble members of your origin.

### Archery Expert
At 5th level, you can use your bonus action to make a ranged weapon attack.

### Secret Folk
At 7th level you become an expert at hiding. If you are within 30 feet of an ally, each ally gains a bonus to their Dexterity (Stealth) check equal to twice your proficiency bonus.

### Superior Marksman
At 9th level, you can shoot other missiles out of the air. When targeted by a ranged weapon attack you may use your reaction to make a ranged weapon attack roll, using the opponent’s attack roll result as your target number. On a success, the opponent’s attack fails.

## Poet-warrior
	THUS SPOKE AROALETA
	“… and the search goes on forever, for the hidden Ambal Seba, where the truth is spelled in gold, where the keys to the primal power are etched in circles, round and round the thirteen pillars. See, the mists will never fade. Not even Fofar the Destroyer can dispel the veil over a valley that does not exist.”

You became a captain not because you love war, or hate oppression, or even wish to profit from your own safety. But instead you are a true philosopher of war, one that observes and then acts with efficiency for its own sake. Your weapon becomes like your pen, a teacher in deeds, not words. And those that survive your lessons would do well to think on them.

### Reflection
When you take a short rest, you can meditate on an enemy that you have fought before. This could be an individual or a specific type of foe. You have advantage on attack rolls against that enemy until you miss, after which the effect ends.

### Withering Words
At 2nd level, you may use either your bonus action or your reaction when a creature that can hear and understand you takes damage. You sap their confidence using choice phrases, observations and reflections on their character. The creature takes an additional 1d6 psychic damage and has disadvantage on its next attack roll.

Once you use this feature you cannot use it again until your next turn.

### Quiet Fortitude
When you reach 3rd level, you have extraordinary sensitivity to what drives people. When you roll initiative, choose a number of allies equal to your proficiency bonus that can hear and understand you. They are considered proficient with all saving throws for the next minute as your quiet words help steel their resolve. You must take a long or extended rest before using this feature again.

### Song of the Blade
At 5th level, choose a melee weapon that you are proficient in. When wielding that weapon, you can use your bonus action to make an additional single attack roll with that weapon.

### Subtle Words
At 7th level, when you use your Bid to Action feature, the ally has advantage on their first ability check or attack roll they make on their turn.

### Dancing Blade
At 9th level, you can combine your skill with words and weapons to inspire fear in your enemies. On your first turn of a combat, choose a creature. If you succeed at a Charisma (Intimidation) check they become frightened of you until the combat ends. The DC is 10 or their challenge rating, whichever is higher.
