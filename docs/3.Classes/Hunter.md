# Hunter
THE HUNTERS AND their toil are of great importance, both for the Ambrians and among the clans of the forest. To commoners in Ambria, they may not appear to be any different from your average rogue, but for many (especially among those living close to Davokar) they are on par with true heroes. Covered in the dirt of the wilds, eyes shining with the light of the future, the hunters are vital in the project of cultivating and taming the great forest.

Among both Ambrians and barbarians, the hunters are often signified by their skillful use of ranged weapons and techniques. Exactly how they fight is primarily decided based on what they are hunting: criminals, monsters or dark-minded sorcerers.

But no matter the target, what unites the hunters is a highly developed sense for where the prey has been, how it moves and to where it is headed – a sense that borders on supernatural precision.

#### HUNTERS AND ORIGINS
All folk have their hunters, but in general it is primarily elves, abducted humans and humans that excel in this role. Still, in Thistle Hold you may very well come across goblins and even a few ogres known as trustworthy guides through the wilds.

Dwarves are not usually seen as hunters in the forest, but some of Ambria’s most widely known bounty hunters are dwarves who for some reason have left their families in Yndaros.

#### HUNTER SHADOWS
The Shadows of hunters can be as dark as the forest they venture into but it depends on their quarry. Ironsworn and monster-hunters tend to be lighter shades of gray than bounty-hunters or especially witch-hunters, which have to be careful not to become what they seek.

### WILDERNESS EXPLORER
Beginning at 1st level, you are adept at preparing and securing campsites in the wilderness so that some of your party can gain additional benefits during a long rest. Choose a number of creatures up to your proficiency bonus to each regain an additional Hit Die. You can include yourself as one of the creatures.

If you spend an hour in the wild and succeed at a DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check, you can supply enough food and drink for your party for one day. You must take a long rest before using this feature again.

### APPROACH
At first level you also choose your approach, which determines the chosen prey of your hunter: are you a Bounty Hunter that chases criminals, an Ironsworn that enforces the ancient treaty, a Monster Hunter that seeks out the most dangerous creatures or a Witch Hunter that seeks corrupted mortals instead?

Your approach gives you benefits at 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 7th and 9th levels.

### HUNTER'S INSTINCT
Starting at 1st level, if you don’t already have a chosen target, you can use a bonus action on your turn to mark one creature as your chosen target. The first time you do damage to the creature on your turn add your proficiency bonus as damage (using the same type of damage as your weapon). If you are wielding a ranged weapon, you can use your reaction to make an attack when the creature uses its own movement, counting the range from the creature’s starting position.

### ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT OR FEAT
When you reach 2nd level, and again at 4th, 5th, 6th, 8th, and 10h level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Instead of improving your ability scores you can instead choose to gain a feat. See [[General Feats]]}for more about feats.

### EXTRA ATTACK
Beginning at 3rd level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 9th level in this class.

### Rapid Shot
You know that in battle, those who act first usually also get to act last.
When combat is imminent but before initiative is rolled, you can spend a Recovery Die to make an immediate ranged or melee weapon attack against a creature in range you can see. You receive advantage on this attack.

### EXPERTISE
At 3rd level, choose either Nature or Survival and one of your other skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of these chosen proficiencies.

At 7th level, choose two more skills. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of these chosen proficiencies.

### LAND'S STRIDE
Starting at 4th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such as those created by the entangle spell.

### HIDE IN PLAIN SIGHT
At 6th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself and a number of creatures up to your proficiency bonus. You must have access to fresh mud or other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage.

Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. While camouflaged, you gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks. You can move at half-speed without breaking the camouflage effect.

Once you take an action, a reaction or move faster than half your speed, you must camouflage again to gain this benefit.

### VANISH
Starting at 7th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can’t be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.

### FERAL SENSES
Starting at 8th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can’t see. When you attack a creature you can’t see, your inability to see it doesn’t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it. You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn’t hidden from you and you aren’t blinded or deafened.

### EXPERT HUNTER
At 10th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or longer rest.

# Hunter Approaches
HUNTERS MIGHT BE Bounty Hunters, who seek the most dangerous prey in city alleyways and other dark places, or Ironsworn, defenders of the Iron Pact. They might elect to become Monster Hunters and venture far into Davokar, or they might be a Witch Hunter, seeking out blighted humans on behalf of the Church or their own personal quest of vengeance.

## Bounty Hunter
During The Great War there were deserters – many doubted that a victory over the Dark Lords was possible. To deal with the problem, King Ynedar, Queen Korinthia’s father, placed a permanent bounty on the heads of the runaways. In doing so, he indirectly founded the guild of the Bounty Hunters. The tradition to pay for having fugitives caught lives on and nowadays the bounty hunters are often forced to venture into the forest of Davokar, where the most desperate – and also most valuable – targets tend to seek refuge.

### Sturdy Holds
If you have a creature your size or smaller grappled, that creature has disadvantage on their attempts to escape the grapple.

### Delicate Conversations
You gain proficiency with the Deception skill.

### Rough Fighting
At 2nd level, you’ve mastered such alleyway techniques as “gutter-kiss” (a head-butt) and “goblin-squeeze” (groin kick). You do 1d6 bludgeoning damage with your unarmed strikes.

At 3rd level you can use your bonus action to have advantage on an attempt to grapple a target that is your size or smaller.

### Urban Tracker
At 5th level, you can find or follow almost anyone in the maze of a city. You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to hide in an urban environment and for Wisdom (Survival) checks to track someone in a city.

### Precise Strike
When you reach 7th level, your ranged weapon accuracy is such that you can disarm a creature with a shot. Use your bonus action when making an attack to attempt a precise strike; on a hit you don’t do any damage but the creature must make a Strength saving throw against your attack roll result or drop what it is holding.

### Stunning Blows
At 9th level, your attacks are designed to bring a foe down without killing them. Use your bonus action when making an attack roll; on a hit, instead of doing damage, the target must make a Constitution saving throw against the attack roll total. On a failure it becomes stunned. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

## Ironsworn

The work of the Iron Pact is never done, which places great demands on its agents, the Ironsworn. The pact was created by elves at the time of Symbaroum’s downfall, and after a long time in the shadows its members are on the move again, trying to stop the spreading darkness. Davokar must never awaken, and it won’t, if the Ironsworn can help it.

Nowadays, the Iron Pact recruits new agents from all origins and cultures; anyone sympathetic to the struggle is tested in a series of both physical and moral challenges. Those who make it with both life and loyalty intact are invited to swear the Iron Oath. After that follows a time of training and further testing before initiates become true members of the Pact – agents devoted to the fight against Corruption.

### Agile Combat
Your armor class when you wear no armor is equal to 10 plus twice your Dexterity modifier.

### Lore of the Wild
You gain proficiency with the Animal Handling and Nature skills.

### Loremaster
You are proficient in the spoken and written forms of Symbaroum and know many things about those ancient people. The character is educated and well-versed in the ways of the world: its cultures, its history, languages and artifacts. For centuries heroes, monsters and kingdoms have come and gone, leaving behind powerful items and secret texts. This ability represents knowledge about such objects. Through extensive studies a character with this ability knows not only the story of an object but also its properties and applications.
- At 2nd level, you can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check to determine the properties of a magic item. On a success, if it is a magic item, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any spells are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a spell, you learn which spell created it. The DC is dependent on the kind of magic item: common (DC 10), uncommon (DC 13), rare (DC 16), very rare (DC 19), legendary (DC 22).
Additionally, you are proficient in both human languages (Ambrian and Barbarian).
- At 3rd level, your understanding of artifacts is extensive enough that you are not as affected by their corruptive power. You may reduce your cost of a single artifact’s permanent Corruption by 1, to a minimum of 1 Corruption.
- At 5th level, you may cast spells of a level equal to or lower than half your proficiency bonus directly from scrolls and such parchments.
You gain advantage on saving throws against magical effects.

### Sniper
At 5th level, your ranged weapon attacks have extraordinary precision. When a creature takes damage from such an attack, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, its speed becomes zero until the end of its next turn. The DC is equal to 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus or the damage, whichever is higher.

At 7th level, you score a critical hit with a ranged weapon on a natural result of 19 or 20.

At 9th level, you double your ability modifier for damage with a ranged weapon.

## Monster Hunter

Monster Hunting Societies

In Thistle Hold, the Monster Hunters have gathered into a number of Societies, of which The Red Claw is the most famous. Other such Societies of note are the boastful newcomers Markas’ Impalers, and the more serious teratologists belonging to Nikanor’s Taxidermists Guild, who collect monster carcasses in good condition for study purposes. Many of these groups have openly established outposts close to Karvosti and frequently visit the newly opened store Crueljaws’ Traps, where the retired ogre who has given the establishment its name sells his ingenious hunting devices.

As more and more Ambrians settle down in the shadow of Davokar, it grows more common that these settlements are haunted by the famished, vindictive or even life-hating horrors of the forest. In light of this growing threat, actionable individuals have developed techniques and skills for hunting monsters – the often considerable price of monster trophies is certainly another incentive! Also the barbarian clans have their monster hunters, even though the people of the forest adhere to the witches’ taboos and seldom live or travel in monster infested areas.

A majority of the Ambrian Monster Hunters are members of monster hunting societies, established in or around places like Thistle Hold and Kastor. These groups both compete and cooperate in the never-ending work to keep the border settlements secure and the members of the societies rich. The latter part, the wealth, has attracted a growing number of barbarian Monster Hunters south, where they have turned into very successful trophy collectors, thanks to their vast knowledge of Davokar.

### The Bigger They are…
You have advantage on all attacks against targets that are Large size or bigger.

### Clever Fingers

You gain proficiency with the Sleight of Hand skill.

Trapper

At 2nd level, you become proficient with alchemical and mechanical traps. You can use your action during combat to deploy a mechanical trap within 5 feet of your position. You are never threatened by the trap but treat movement within 5 feet of a trapped area as difficult terrain. You can use your action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to disable a mechanical trap. The DC is given on the @UUID[Compendium.symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-player-guide-journal.yVYJwqVtcJU3MQuY.JournalEntryPage.y7BYuRbNTawlODTC#traps]{Traps Table}.

At 3rd level, you can use your action during combat to deploy a mechanical or alchemical trap within 5 feet of your position. You are never threatened by the trap but treat movement within 5 feet of a trapped area as difficult terrain. You can use your action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to disable a mechanical or alchemical trap.

At 5th level, if you have time before a combat, you can prepare an area with improvised traps. Each trap requires 10 minutes of preparation and does 1d8 damage (bludgeoning, piercing or slashing, depending on the trap design). See @Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-player-guide-journal.yVYJwqVtcJU3MQuY]{Traps}for rules on traps.

Polearm Master

When you have reached the 7th level, when a creature comes within reach of your weapon you can use your reaction to make a single attack using a weapon with reach against that creature.

At 9th level, any melee attacks against you with a weapon whose reach is smaller than yours have disadvantage.

## Witch Hunter

THUS SPOKE AROALETA

“… and troll-mother Vouax’s cauldron, lined with the words of the weaver, smeared with the fat of the wardens, fell down the abyss, fell into oblivion. The vessel brewing the downfall of all may never again be heated, not by fire, not by the dark of the Abyss.”

You have dedicated your life to fighting blight beasts, maybe as a consequence of having your own life torn apart by the growing and infectious darkness: a farm burned to the ground, the grave of your family, a friend’s horrendous transformation – something that reminds you of what will happen if the power of the blighted ones is not broken in time.

You will stop at nothing in your fight against evil: you wield steel, fire and even rituals learned from defeated sorcerers. You realize that the use of mystical powers may ultimately corrupt you too, but you turn a blind eye to that and instead fight on with the fervor of the fanatic.

Deep Knowledge

At 1st level you gain proficiency with both Arcana and Religion, representing your knowledge of transgressive magic and the proper teachings of the Church of Prios.

Ritualist

At 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 7th and 9th level choose a ritual spell (one with the ritual tag) from the Theurg tradition list. The spell level must be equal to or lower than half your current proficiency bonus.

You gain permanent Corruption (see {[[Corruption and Shadow]]}) equal to half the spell level, rounded up. If the ritual is a cantrip, you gain no permanent Corruption. You can only cast the chosen spell as a ritual – the ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal and can only be cast at its base level. You gain no Corruption from casting one of these spells.

Deadly Need

Starting at 3rd level you have learned enough of the sorcerous arts that, if pressed, you can cast a spell at need. You can cast one of the spells you know as a non-ritual spell but you gain twice the normal Corruption since your understanding of the magical arts is limited.

Steadfast

At 5th level, as part of your ritual learnings, you have developed both an iron will and stomach. You can use your reaction to give yourself advantage on a Constitution or Wisdom saving throw.

You can do this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus and then must take a short or longer rest before using this feature again.

Retributive Rebuke

At 7th level, when you succeed at a saving throw granted to you by Steadfast and the source of the saving throw was a spellcaster, that creature takes 1d6 psychic damage.

At 9th level, the psychic damage increases to 1d12.
