# Scoundrel

IN AMBRIA THE word “scoundrel” is used broadly and refers to all who “steal” something from others, be it their trust, secrets, money or life. The calling of the warrior, to proudly face an opponent face-­to-­face, is an exception to this rule: it is the sneaky assassin that counts among the thieving scoundrels. In essence, warriors, craftsmen and scholars are the ideal occupations among the Ambrians; the rest are more or less regarded as scoundrels.

##### SCOUNDRELS AND ORIGINS
People at large would say that changelings and goblins are synonymous with scoundrels, and are usually surprised when they realize that ogres and humans can also be found amongst their number.

##### SCOUNDREL SHADOWS
The Shadows of scoundrels are invariably darker than their fellows’, but the nature of their appearance varies based on their focus. A charlatan looks like they’re wearing a mask or hood of deep shadow while a thug is grim and gray all over. Tendrils of darkness emerge from a treasure-­hunter’s heart and a ranger is cloaked by a green so dark that it seems black and it obscures their movements.

EXPERTISE

At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves' tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies. At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves' tools) to gain this benefit.

BACKSTAB

Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with a melee weapon attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. You must be proficient with the weapon used.

You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the ­attack roll.

The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Backstab column of the Scoundrel table.

APPROACH

At first level you also choose your approach, the way that your scoundrel interacts with the world: are they an Explorer, a Spy, a Treasure-hunter, a Thug, or a Sapper? Each approach deals with subterfuge and a careful approach to problems, but they typically find themselves in different environments with drastically different foes.

Your approach gives you benefits at 1st, 3rd, 6th, 9th, 13th and 17th levels.

CUNNING ACTION

Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT OR FEAT

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Instead of improving your ability scores you can instead choose to gain a feat. See @Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-player-guide-journal.5Ya7wZlEARDOWd2u]{01.4a - Classes and Feats}for more about feats.

### UNCANNY DODGE

Starting at 3rdlevel, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.

### Amazing Dodge

You twist, bend, and roll out of the path of an incoming attack

When you use your Uncanny Dodge feature, you can spend a Recovery Die to further reduce the damage you suffer. Subtract the result of the roll before halving the damage. You can expend more than one Recovery Die to reduce the damage as part of your Uncanny Dodge, to a maximum equal to your proficiency bonus.

### EVASION

Beginning at 4th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as an ice storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

RELIABLE TALENT

By 6thlevel, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

### BLINDSENSE

Starting at 7th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.

### SLIPPERY MIND

By 8th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.

### ELUSIVE

Beginning at 9th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren’t incapacitated.

### STROKE OF LUCK

At 10th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or longer rest.

## Scoundrel Approaches

WE COVER THE Explorer approach for those who wish to get into trouble in the wild, the Former Cultist for scoundrels with a dark history, a Guild Thief for one that follows (certain) rules, Sappers that attack the foundations of society, Spies that seek secret information on behalf of their master, Thugs that serve as the chosen enforcers of other criminals and Treasure-­hunters that are only concerned with finding more valuables.

Explorer

You have chosen to turn away from civilization and strike out into the wilderness. Your home is in the deep forest or the mountain valley, where you hunt beasts for food and fur or to protect inhabitants and travelers from harm. You have learned how to stay clear of your enemies’ reach while your arrows still find their mark.

Precise Shot

You can add your backstab damage to a ranged weapon attack. You must either have advantage on the attack or have an ally within 5 feet of the target and not have disadvantage on the attack.

Wilderness-­master

You gain proficiency with the Nature and Survival skills along with the Light Crossbow and Longbow.

Steadfast Watch

At 2nd level, you become so adept at preparing and securing campsites in the wilderness that some of your party can gain additional benefits during a long rest. Choose a number of creatures up to your proficiency bonus to each regain a Hit Die. You can include yourself as one of the creatures.

Specialties

When you reach 3rd level, choose one of the following specialties.

Marksman

Marksmen have their natural position in every army, scouting party and band of brigands. You can inflict serious damage on enemies with a bow or crossbow, hoping to either bring them down or at least make sure that they do not reach your allies who are equipped only for melee combat.

- At the start of your turn you can use your bonus action to aim. Your speed becomes 0 and you now have advantage on ranged weapon attacks.
- At 5th level you score a critical hit on ranged weapon attacks with a natural roll of 19 or 20 on the die.
- At 7th level you no longer suffer disadvantage for being at long range.

Monster Lore

The character is schooled in the lore of beasts and knows the secrets of most monsters. Many monsters possess special abilities and unique attacks as well as weaknesses which are good to know about when trying to bring them down.

- Make an Intelligence (Nature) check with the DC equal to 10 plus the challenge rating (rounding down for fractional ratings) of any beast, giant, humanoid or plant. On a success, the GM must inform you of any vulnerabilities, resistances or immunities the creature possesses and provide you with a general assessment of its threat to the party (‘minimal’, ’average’, or ’severe’).
- At 5th level, you can also make the same assessment of dragons, elementals, fey and monstrosities.
- At 7th level you can make the same assessment for abominations, constructs, oozes and undead.

Sixth Sense

When moving through dark forests or mountain tunnels, one’s eyes are no longer very useful. Lighting a lantern or torch may attract dangers, so the explorer had better learn to rely on their other senses. With dedicated training it is possible to awaken these other senses and sharpen them to the brink of eeriness.

- You can see in dim light as if it were normal light. In complete darkness, you rely on your other senses to give you blindsight within 30 feet. You never receive disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks due to darkness.
- At 5th level, you are always aware of your environment and cannot be surprised.
- At 7th level, your blindsight increases to a 90-foot range.

Wilderness Home

At 9th level you are almost more comfortable in the wilderness than civilization. You and a number of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus can take long or extended rests almost anywhere in the wilderness. Your camp is always considered a safe location.

Former Cultist

Many sorcerers foster cults around themselves and their beliefs, promising drug-­induced insights and black salvation to those willing to follow the mystic into the dark. Not many defect from such cults and those who do and survive more than a few days are fewer still, hunted as they are by both the cult they left behind and by witch hunters and Black Cloaks. The situation is not made any easier by the defector’s own burdens – memories of services rendered to please their master and explicitly cruel actions performed in the name of the cult weigh most Former Cultists down and haunt their nightmares long after leaving the master.

You might have been a deeply convinced fanatic, or someone for whom the membership was more of a practical choice motivated by ambition or greed. However, if one is to believe the interrogation protocols of the Black Cloaks, desperation is the most common characteristic among cultists – the injustices of life combined with a charismatic leader who promises redemption and strength can be an attractive combination. But no matter your background, the choices of the cultist were never innocent; your hands are forever colored by blood.

Channeling

You were taught some of the lesser powers of your sorcerous master. Like other Sorcerers, your spellcasting ability modifier is Charisma. You learn spells from the Sorcerer tradition list.

Corruption Threshold = (your proficiency bonus × 2) + your Charisma modifier

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

|   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Level|Cantrips Known|Total 1st|Total 2nd|Total 3rd|Total 4th|
|1st|2|1|-|-|-|
|2nd|3|2|-|-|-|
|3rd|4|3|1|-|-|
|5th|5|4|2|1|-|
|7th|5|4|3|2|1|
|9th|5|4|4|3|2|

You know two cantrips and one 1st level spell from the sorcerer list, plus the detect magic spell. You do not have any favored spells. You learn spells according to the chart to the right, and can cast any spell you know at any time, gaining Corruption each time.

The Darkened Path

Like your former master, you are used to bearing Corruption as you seek power. When you make a Corruption check, you have advantage on the d20 roll. Note: this is for the initial roll to determine if you gain a mark of Corruption, not the roll to determine the mark’s nature.

Alchemy

At 2nd level, you gain proficiency with Alchemist’s supplies, which you can use to produce elixirs (see - Alchemical Elixirs) or identify drugs and poisons, or to gain clues as to where they came from. You have a natural talent to create elixirs. You can also make a DC 10 Intelligence (Alchemist’s supplies) check to produce one dose of a weak or basic elixir. You must take an extended rest before using your talent again to manufacture an elixir.

- When you reach 5th level, you can make a DC 15 Intelligence (Alchemist’s supplies) check to produce one dose of a moderate elixir or 1d3+1 doses of a weak or basic elixir. You must take an extended rest before using your talent again to manufacture an elixir.
- When you attain 9th level, you can make a DC 20 Intelligence (Alchemist’s supplies) check to produce one dose of a strong elixir, or 1d3+1 doses of a moderate elixir, or 1d6+2 doses of a weak or basic elixir. You must take an extended rest before using your talent again to manufacture an elixir.

Poisoner

At 3rd level, you become bold enough to try your hand at the arts of poison. While taking a short or long rest, you can prepare a weapon or 20 pieces of ammunition with a poisonous coating. Make a DC 15 Intelligence (Poisoner’s kit) check:

- If you succeed by 5 or more, the weapon adds (a) 1d6 poison damage to any successful strike and (b) the creature must make a Constitution saving throw vs 8 + your Intelligence modifier + your proficiency bonus or become poisoned for one minute.
- If you score a normal success, you can choose either (a) or (b) but not both.
- If you fail by four or less, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw as (b), but the Poisoned effect lasts only until the end of its next turn and it takes no damage.
- If you fail by five or more the poison has no effect.

In any case, the poison lasts only until your next rest, at which time you must either reapply it or go without.

At 7th level the poison damage rises to 3d6.

Guild Thief

The Guild Thief has a long, if not proud, tradition rooted in Alberetor, a tradition that emerged stronger after the relocation to the north. Each of Ambria’s towns has at least one Thieves’ Guild, larger ones often have one based in each district or block.

Not just anyone is qualified to be a Guild Thief. Sure, pick-­pockets and simplistic thugs may prove to be suitable recruits but only the most cunning and agile can hope to gain membership in the Guild. To strike unnoticed and know who is untouchable are matters of principle to the Guild Thief.

Speciality Each Guild Thief chooses one avenue to specialize in:

- Fence Work. Become proficient with Deception if you’re not already. You have a Market contact.
- Overhead Work. Become proficient with Acrobatics if you’re not already. Your climb speed is equal to your normal speed.
- Special Work. You focus on higher-end targets. Gain a Noble contact.
- Streetwise Work. Become proficient with Sleight of Hand if you are not yet. You have an Alleyway contact.

If you gain a contact, this is a person you can have a social challenge () with to learn appropriate information.

Blade Work

If you are wielding only knives or daggers, add your ability modifier to damage with your off-­hand weapon.

At 3rd level, you are an expert at close-­in fighting. If you’re wielding knives or daggers in both hands and your opponent has longer weapons they have disadvantage on their attack rolls against you. Natural weapons don’t trigger this feature.

Cheap Shot

At 2nd level, you’ve mastered such alleyway techniques as “gutter-­kiss” (a head-­butt) and “goblin-­squeeze” (groin kick). You do 1d6 bludgeoning damage with your unarmed strikes.

At 5th level you can use your bonus action to gain one of the following benefits:

- Make two additional unarmed attacks.
- Make a single strike that, instead of doing damage, may stun your opponent. The target must make a Constitution saving throw against 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a failure, they are stunned until the end of your next turn.

Opportunist

When you reach 7th level, you have advantage on any opportunity attacks. If you deal damage to a creature with an opportunity attack their movement becomes zero.

Trapper

At 9th level, you can use your action during combat to deploy an alchemical or mechanical trap within 5 feet of your position. You are never threatened by the trap but treat movement within 5 feet of a trapped area as difficult terrain. See for rules on traps.


Spy

Already during The Great War there were secret agents working for the King and the court in Alberetor. After the war, the agency lay dormant until the recent troubling times made Queen Korinthia breathe life into what is called the Royal Sekretorium.

The Sekretorium consists of a number of reliable nobles who secretly enforce the Queen’s command to infiltrate various operations and hunt for sensitive information – or spread disinformation. The committee is led by high-­borns, while the field work is carried out by nobles of lower rank. A vital part of the operations is aimed at Korinthia’s own allies within the Sun Church, Ordo Magica, the military and also the duchies of the realm, meaning the Queen’s close relatives. Some Spies are not equipped to handle the intrigues and moral ambiguities; others are cast out in the cold after incriminating failures. Former Spies of the Queen often live short lives, constantly on the run from both enemies and their former superiors.

Some other organizations surely have a few spies placed in Ambria, causing many people to be suspicious of converted barbarians, changelings, abducted humans who have returned, and other strangers.

Dissembling Words

Spies gain proficiency in the Deception skill.

Network of Contacts

As a spy, you’ve built up a group of individuals that can provide you with information. You number of contacts is equal to twice your proficiency bonus. When you first take this approach and each time your proficiency bonus increases, you can select new contacts. You can learn appropriate information from them or arrange a meeting with a person of that social level by meeting with your contact (see Social Challenges).

Each belongs to one of the following types:

- Alleyway Contact. This contact is in touch with the shady dealings of a community and the lowest rungs of society.
- Market Contact. This contact is involved in the trade concerns of the community and the middle class merchants and traders.
- Noble Contact. This contact is involved in the political concerns of the community and the machinations of the royalty and other nobles for control of the community.

Feint

You have developed techniques for feinting – handling a weapon in both a discreet and confusing manner. You must be wielding a weapon with the finesse property to use these features.

At 1st level you can use your bonus action to intentionally leave an opening free in your defense to take advantage of later. Until your next turn, when an opponent attacks you they have advantage on the attack but you can use your reaction to make an attack roll immediately after their attack. Attackers lose advantage once you use your reaction.

At 3rd level, you can use your bonus action to make a feint against an opponent. Make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check against an opponent’s armor class. If successful, you have advantage on attacks against that opponent until the end of your turn.

Twin Attack

At 2nd level, if you are wielding a finesse melee weapon in your primary hand and a light weapon in the other hand, you add your ability modifier to damage rolls with your off hand.

At 5th level you can wield a finesse weapon in each hand and add your ability modifier to damage rolls with each hand.

Poisoner

At 3rd level, you become bold enough to try your hand at the arts of poison. While taking a short or long rest, you can prepare a weapon with a poisonous coating. Make a DC 15 Intelligence (Poisoner’s kit) check and compare it to below:

- If you succeed by 5 or more, the weapon adds 1d6 poison damage to any successful strike and the creature must make a Constitution saving throw vs 8 + your Intelligence modifier + your proficiency bonus or become poisoned for one minute.
- If you score a normal success, you can choose one of the above effects but not both.
- If you fail by four or less, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw as above, but the Poisoned effect lasts only until the end of its next turn and it takes no damage.
- If you fail by five or more the poison has no effect.

In any case, the poison lasts only until your next rest, at which time you must either reapply it or go without.

At 7th level the poison damage rises to 3d6.

At 9th level, the poison damage rises to 5d6.

Thug

The eastern districts of Yndaros are a wilderness as dangerous as Davokar, and just as rewarding for those who know how to harvest its fruits. You grew up on streets whose gangs have taught you the art of making a profit from others’ hard work, right under the noses of the city watch. Other Thugs rise through the ranks by becoming employed by barons or counts, free to act as ruffians and enforcers without being bothered by the Queen’s watchmen.

You have always preferred the direct approach, dispensing violence directly against your enemies and your employer’s enemies.

Twin Attack

At 1st level, if you are wielding a finesse melee weapon in your primary hand and a light weapon in the other hand, you add your ability modifier to damage rolls with your off hand.

At 3rd level you can wield a finesse weapon in each hand and add your ability modifier to damage rolls with each hand.

Acrobatic Fighter

By 2nd level, if you are not already proficient with Acrobatics you become proficient with that skill. When a weapon attack targets you, you can use your reaction to make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check with the attack roll result as the DC. If you succeed, you take no damage from the attack.

Strangler

Once you reach 5th level, if you are grappling a living creature your size or smaller and are not carrying anything else, you may use a garrote to strangle the creature as your action. If you have a creature garroted at the start of their turn, they begin to choke and will become unconscious after a number of rounds equal to their Constitution modifier. A garroted creature can’t call out for help, but might be able to get an ally’s attention by other means.

At 7th level, when you have a creature garroted they have disadvantage on their Escape attempts.

At 9th level, when you grapple a creature you can use Dexterity (Acrobatics) to initiate the grapple.

Treasure-­hunter

The depths of Davokar hide many treasures; to locate, salvage and return them to civilization is your bread and butter. You dream of overgrown ruins and fantasize about sunken temples. Unlike many others, you have proven yourself willing to risk your life in order to succeed. You have developed an impressive set of skills in order to do just that and there are few situations within Davokar for which you have not prepared a strategy.

Steel Throw

At 1st level, you can use your Backstab feature if you make a ranged weapon attack with a throwing weapon.

By 7th level, you have become an expert at throwing weapons. You do not receive disadvantage with throwing weapons for being at long range and score a critical hit on a natural roll of 19 or 20.

Tactician

Also at 1st level, you have extensively studied small-­scale combat. You have advantage on initiative rolls.

Alchemy

At 2nd level, you gain proficiency with alchemist’s supplies, which you can use to produce elixirs (see Alchemical Elixirs) or identify drugs and poisons, or to gain clues as to where they came from. You can also make a DC 10 Intelligence (Alchemist’s supplies) check to produce one dose of a weak or basic elixir. You must take an extended rest before trying again to manufacture an elixir.

- When you reach 5th level, you can make a DC 15 Intelligence (Alchemist’s supplies) check to produce one dose of a moderate elixir or 1d3+1 doses of a weak or basic elixir. You must take an extended rest before trying again to manufacture an elixir.
- When you attain 9th level, you can make a DC 20 Intelligence (Alchemist’s supplies) check to produce one dose of a strong elixir, or 1d3+1 doses of a moderate elixir, or 1d6+2 doses of a weak or basic elixir. You must take an extended rest before trying again to manufacture an elixir.

Fast Hands

Also starting at 2nd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves’ tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.

Nimbleness

At 3rd level, you gain the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement. In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier. You also have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.

Treasure Surveyor

At 5th level, you have a keen eye for value and when you find a curiosity or a Mystical treasure in a ruin you can double its value at market.
