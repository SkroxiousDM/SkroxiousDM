THE BARBARIAN CLANS of Davokar and the kingdom of Ambria house many traditions of war and combat. Some warriors are professionals – soldiers with a pragmatic point of view, regarding warfare as a vocation. Others stem from noble families and bloodlines, and consider the glory of battle to be a part of their heritage. To some the art of war is nothing more than a method needed to survive, while others use their prowess in battle for a higher purpose, such as serving Prios the Sun God or restoring family honor lost during The Great War.

Regardless of culture and origins, the warrior’s main arena is the battlefield, where he or she often assumes the role of a heavily armed shock trooper. The warrior can also contribute to effective problem-­solving, mainly through their capacity to lead.

# WARRIORS AND ORIGINS

Ogres are commonly considered to be exemplary warriors, closely followed by humans and dwarves. Changelings are seldom regarded as classical warrior material, and the same goes for goblins. You can definitely find warriors among changelings and goblins, but these tend to rely on agility and finesse rather than on raw physical strength.

- Weapons: Simple weapons, martial weapons
- Tools: None
- Saving Throws: Strength, Constitution

- (a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) two handaxes
- (a) a dungeoneer’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack

### BATTLE WIND

You are familiar with the ebb and flow of battle and know how to defend yourself against the wild blows of desperate opponents. When you are hit by an attack roll you can use your reaction to gain temporary hit points equal to 2d4 + your Constitution modifier. You immediately gain the temporary hit points and can apply damage from the triggering attack to them.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus and then you must take a long or extended rest before using this feature again.

### FIGHTING STYLE

You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

##### Archery

You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

##### Defense

While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

##### Dueling

When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

##### Great Weapon Fighting

When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-­handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

##### Polearm Fighting

When wielding a reach weapon, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on a melee attack roll within your reach.

##### Shield Fighting

If you make a successful melee attack roll you can use your bonus action to slam the target with your shield. If the target is your size or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw against 10 plus your Strength (Athletics) modifier. On a failure you can choose to move it 10 feet in a line, or cause the creature to become prone.

##### Snare Fighting

If using a weapon with the ensnaring property and you make a successful attack roll, you can spend a bonus action to forgo doing damage, instead tripping the target and causing it to fall prone. This only works on creatures your size or smaller with two or less legs or similarly shaped targets.

##### Two-­Weapon Fighting

When you engage in two-­weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

##### new fighting style: Mounted

You are considered trained in mounted combat. You can also force a single attack roll targeted at your mount to target you instead.

### APPROACH

At 1st level you also choose your approach to the profession of fighting. Are you a Berserker, dangerous to friends and foes alike? A studied Duelist used to combat against a single opponent? A Knight who has pledged their very life to the protection of the kingdom? A Tattoed Warrior using the power of runes? A faithful Templar? Or one of the dangerous Wraithguard?

Your approach gives you benefits at 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 7th and 9th levels.

### ACTION SURGE

Starting at 1st level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action. Once you use this feature, you must finish a rest of any length before you can use it again. Starting at 8th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.

### ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT OR FEAT

When you reach 2nd level, and again at 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 10th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Instead of improving your ability scores you can instead choose to gain a feat. See @Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-player-guide-journal.5Ya7wZlEARDOWd2u]{01.4a - Classes and Feats}for more about feats.

### EXTRA ATTACK

Beginning at 3rd level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 6th level in this class and to four when you reach 9th level in this class.

### Second Wind  
Your reserves are gone but the battle stands at a critical point. You push past all physical limits, drawing on sheer willpower to keep fighting.  
At 3rd level you can use a bonus action to regain vigor points equal to 1d10 + your warrior level by spending a Recovery Die. Usable once per rest.

### INDOMITABLE

Beginning at 4th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can’t use this feature again until you finish a long or extended rest.

### UNDYING COURAGE

At 10th level you can shrug off effects that would incapacitate lesser warriors. When required to make a saving throw you can choose to pass it instead. If you do so, you cannot do so again until you take a rest of any length.

# Warrior Approaches

THOSE WHO FIGHT have a variety of techniques from the wild attacks of Berserkers to the controlled grace of the Duelist, the protective arts of the Knight, the strange techniques of the Tattooed Fighter, the faith of the Templar and the unwavering resilience of the Wrathguard.

## Berserker

Spirits of rage follow you and fill you with uncontrolled ferocity in battle. When you are not in combat you are of a thoughtful and patient disposition, a contrast that makes you both appreciated and feared. The barbarians speak of the Guard of the Slumbering Wrath (see {Wrathguard}), that serve as the High Chieftain’s bodyguard – do you dream of joining their ranks, or do you seek to defeat one of them as revenge for taking your place among them?

### Rage

In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action. While in this raging state, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing heavy armor:

- You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
- When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll. The bonus damage is 1 + half of your proficiency bonus, rounded up.
- You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
- If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while in a rage.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.

Once you have used your rage a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, you must finish a long or extended rest before you can use this feature again.

### Reckless Attack

Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.

### Mindless Rage

Beginning at 3rd level, you can’t be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage.

### Brutal Critical

At 5th level, if you are raging, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.

At 7th level, this increases to two additional dice.

At 9th level, this increases to three additional dice.

### Incredible Might

Beginning at 9th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.

## Duelist

THUS SPOKE AROALETA

“... and he who was called ‘first among equals’ was nevertheless the fastest, the toughest and the most skilled with the spear; he was Maiesticar, the pillager who thrust Spiderbane at the heart of the Spider King, and all the way through.”

Honor and glory is everything for a warrior, and even better if one can defend their name with some flair and finesse. You have been living your whole life guided by that code and the fact that you are still alive undoubtedly speaks well of your talent.

### Feint

You have developed techniques for feinting – handling a weapon in both a discreet and confusing manner. You must be wielding a weapon with the finesse property to use these features. At 1st level you can use your bonus action to intentionally leave an opening free in your defense to take advantage of later. Until your next turn, when an opponent attacks you they have advantage on the attack but you can use your reaction to make an attack roll immediately after their attack. Attackers lose advantage once you use your reaction.

At 3rd level, you can use your bonus action to make a feint against an opponent. Make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check against an opponent’s armor class. If successful, you have advantage on attacks against that opponent until the end of your turn.

### Twin Attack

When you reach 2nd level, if you are wielding a finesse melee weapon in your primary hand and a light weapon in the other hand, you add your ability modifier to damage rolls with your off hand.

At 5th level you can wield a finesse weapon in each hand and add your ability modifier to damage rolls with each hand.

### Bladed Defense

At 7th level, when you wield two melee weapons increase your armor class by 2.

### Lightning-Quick Blades

Also at 7th level, if you wield two melee weapons, when you use your reaction to make an opportunity attack you make two attack rolls, one with each hand.

### Acrobatic Footing

At 9th level, you are immune to the prone condition, as you’ve trained yourself to roll with any blows and then immediately regain your stance.

## Knight

You are a noble Knight who fights to break the enemy’s lines or to hold your own. Heavily armored on the outside and with a deep sense of duty on the inside, you fight for the favor of your lord, the lives of your allies or your own family’s glory.

Maybe you dream of one day becoming a member of the Queen’s royal guard, the Pansars, or a Templar fighting in the name of Prios.

### Bodyguard

You are trained to put yourself between those you escort and any danger.

You can use your reaction to take a blow meant for another creature within 5 feet of you. You must be within 5 feet of the attacker. The attack roll against the original target is compared to your armor class and you take damage only if it would strike you.

At 3rd level, when you use your reaction for this feature you may also make a single attack roll against the attacking creature if you are wielding a weapon capable of hitting it.

### Two-­handed Force

At 2nd level, if you are wielding a two-­handed heavy or massive melee weapon and miss an attack roll, you can use your reaction to reroll that attack.

At 5th level when you wield a heavy or massive melee weapon you score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the die.

### Equestrian

At 5th level, you are adept at handling mounts in combat and can force an opponent to always attack you and ignore your mount. You also gain proficiency in Animal Handling.

### Man-­at-­Arms

At 7th level you become an expert with armor, being able to position it for maximum effect and familiar with wearing it. Your armor class is improved by 1 as long as you are wearing armor. Furthermore, your time required to don or doff armor is half the normal amount.

### Peerless Effort

By 9th level, you have advantage on all melee weapon ­attack rolls.

## Tattooed Fighter

Many barbarian warriors have their bodies covered with tattoos, but the Tattooed Fighters of Vajvod differ in that they are tattooed by symbolists – mystics with a special understanding of the power of symbols. The foremost among the tattooed fighters has the honor to serve as the guards of Clan Vajvod’s chieftain.

There are also goblins and dwarves among the Tattooed Fighters, totally unrelated to the work of Vajvod’s symbolists. Amid both dwarves and goblins, these warriors comprise an elite among the elite. The Tattooed Fighters are often seen fighting alongside their ruler on the field of battle, be it down in the Underworld or in the shadowy depths of Davokar.

### Unarmored Defense

While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. If you are unarmored your base speed increases by 10 feet.

### Rune Tattoos

The rune crafters of Clan Vajvod in eastern Davokar often tattoo themselves and their allies with powerful runes. These runes seem almost alive and glow red-­hot when activated in combat. The character carries such tattoos, either self-­made or granted to the character as a gift or a reward, likely for a service of great importance for the symbolist who made it.

At 1st level, the rune tattoo protects from weather and wind like a full set of clothes. When attacked, you can spend your reaction and gain +4 to your AC until the start of your next turn and you gain 1 point of temporary Corruption. As long as you choose to continue to gain Corruption at the start of your turn, you can continue this effect for additional rounds.

At 2nd level, the rune tattoo adds power to your attacks. Use your bonus action to empower your weapon and gain 1 point of temporary Corruption. Add 1d6 radiant damage to each attack until the beginning of your next turn.

At 3rd level, the rune tattoo glows when you take a wound. At the start of your turn, you can choose to gain 1 point of temporary Corruption. If so, you can spend and roll a Hit die and regenerate hit points equal to your roll plus your proficiency bonus.

At 5th level, the rune tattoo adds even more power to your attacks. Add 1d8 radiant damage (instead of 1d6) to each attack.

At 7th level the increased power becomes 1d10 radiant damage per attack and at 9th level it is 1d12 radiant damage per attack.

## Templar

The church of Prios and its representatives are protected by the Knights of the Dying Sun, heavily armed and with the fire of faith burning behind their breastplates. The power of faith makes the armor of the sun knights harder than steel. Their mere presence repels abominations by the sheer radiance of their conviction or by weapons burning with Prios’ holy rage.

Lately, a schism is said to have grown between the commander of the Templars and the Church’s Curia in Templewall. Initially, the dispute was about how to handle the ancient sun temple found close to Karvosti, but apparently there are other ideological differences between the Knights of the Dying Sun and the Sun Church in general. What will come of this conflict is not easily guessed; some dismiss it as a natural effect of the Church’s development, others whisper of a possible division of the Church, in line with the conflicting views that exist regarding the dying Prios and humanity’s role in the drama.

### Armored Mystic

Despite your extensive training in weapons and warfare, you have also been introduced to the ways of the mystic (see [Mystic](https://skroxiousdm.github.io/SkroxiousDM/3.Classes/Mystic)). Like other Theurgs, your spellcasting ability modifier is Wisdom. You learn spells from the [Theurg tradition list](https://skroxiousdm.github.io/SkroxiousDM/6.Spells/Spell%20Lists/Theurg).

If your Wisdom modifier is higher than your Charisma modifier, you can use it instead of Charisma to calculate your Corruption Threshold.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

You know two cantrips and one 1st level spell from the Theurg list, in addition to the [[bless](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/bless/)] spell. You do not have any favored spells. You learn spells according to the chart below, and can cast any spell you know at any time

|Level|Cantrips Known|Total 1st|Total 2nd|Total 3rd|Total 4th|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1st|1|1|-|-|-|
|2nd|2|2|-|-|-|
|3rd|3|3|-|-|-|
|4th|3|3|1|-|-|
|5th|3|4|2|-|-|
|6th|4|4|3|-|-|
|7th|4|4|3|1|-|
|8th|4|4|4|2|-|
|9th|5|4|4|3|-|
|10th|5|4|4|3|1|




### Holy Aura

At 2nd level, your devotion to Prios and understanding of his power has suffused your very muscles with magical power. When you make a successful melee attack roll you can choose to gain Corruption just as if you were casting a spell that you know. Roll for temporary Corruption as normal and add three times that amount in radiant damage to your attack.

Example: Brinana is a 2nd level Templar fighting a ­Blighted enemy. She can cast up to second level spells and decides to unleash that power when her sword strikes her adversary. She gains 4 (1d4 + 2) temporary Corruption and does 12 points of radiant damage in addition to her weapon damage.

### Theurgy

By 3rd level, you have learned more of the secret arts taught by the Church of Prios. You can choose either the ‘Turn Undead’ feature or the ‘Medicus’ feature below:

#### Turn Undead

You can use the power of the Lawgiver to rebuke the un­dying. As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead within 30 feet that can see and/or hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. You can do this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus before needing to take a long or extended rest to use the feature again.

#### Medicus

You can invest some of your faith into healing energies that do not incur any chance of Corruption to you. If you spend an action binding a wound, you restore one Hit Die to the treated creature. You can do this a number of times equal to twice your proficiency bonus and then must take an extended rest to recharge.

###  Witchhammer

At 5th level, your weapons are imbued with the power of Prios. Add 1d8 radiant damage to all of your melee weapons.

At 7th level this becomes 1d10 and at 9th level it becomes 1d12 radiant damage.

## Weapon Master

You have dedicated yourself to the mastery of a single weapon. Among the warriors of Ambria and Davokar there are those who have committed themselves to becoming true masters of a specific weapon. Through persistent training, these Weapon Masters have become very skilled with their weapon of choice, and often adhere to a philosophy about the struggle between life and death.

They are known as Sword Saints in Ambria, devoted to perfecting their skill with the chosen weapon. Among barbarians there are the Axe Artists, often wielding one axe in each hand – a tradition also adopted by some of the goblin tribes of Davokar. The elven equivalent to a weapon master is called a Spear Dancer, an art form also practiced by abducted humans. Among dwarves, chain weapons are considered extra noble, both very demanding and very effective in the right hands. Such Flailers, in the form of ogres, can often be found in the gladiatorial arenas of Ambria.

### Fighting Style Mastery

You gain the appropriate benefit based on your chosen weapon mastery:

- If you are a Sword Saint, then the Dueling fighting style provides +3 bonus damage.
- If you are an Axe Artist, then one of your two weapons used in Two-Weapon Fighting does not need to be light. (It cannot be heavy, massive or two-­handed.)
- If you are a Spear Dancer, then your spear counts as having reach.
- If you are a Flailer, when you use a bonus action to trip an opponent they also take damage equal to your Strength modifier.

### Acrobatic Fighter

At 2nd level, if you are not already proficient with Acrobatics you become proficient with that skill. When a weapon attack targets you, you can use your reaction to make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check with the attack roll result as the DC. If you succeed, you take no damage from the attack.

### Combat Speciality

At 3rd level, your intense dedication to your weapon training shows itself with a new feature:

- For Sword Saints, you can use your reaction after taking damage from a melee attack to make a single attack roll against that attacker with your sword if the attacker is in reach.
- For Axe Artists, when you succeed at your first attack roll you can use your reaction to gain advantage on your second attack roll.
- For Spear Dancers as long as you wield only your spear, you have a +1 bonus to AC.
- For Flailers, when an attacker fails on their attack roll, you can use your reaction to ensnare their weapon. Make an opposed Strength check, if you succeed the attacker is disarmed.

### Combat Mastery

At 5th level, your continuing dedication to your weapon training provides another feature:

- For Sword Saints, you can use your reaction after a missed melee attack to make a single attack roll against that attacker with your sword if the attacker is in reach.
- For Axe Artists, you score a critical hit with either of your axes when you roll a 19 or 20 on the d20 for an attack roll.
- For Spear Dancers, when you make a successful attack roll you can use your bonus action to force the target creature to make a Dexterity saving throw with the DC equal to the attack roll. On a failure, the creature is knocked prone.
- For Flailers, when you miss with your weapon you can use your reaction to whip the chain back and make a second attack roll.

### Man-­at-­Arms

At 7th level you become an expert with armor, being able to position it for maximum effect and familiar with wearing it. Your armor class is improved by 1 as long as you are wearing armor. Furthermore, your time required to don or doff armor is half the normal amount.

 At 9th level the bonus to your armor class becomes +2 and you can don or doff armor in one-­quarter the normal time.

## Wrathguard

The High Chieftain of Karvosti is guarded by a select number of warriors in the Guard of the Slumbering Wrath. Anyone who has met a Wrathguard in combat knows that there is nothing drowsy about them. On the contrary, the blood of a Wrathguard boils with fighting spirit, and the Huldra teaches them to use that passion effectively. To damage a Wrathguard is to wake their fury; to badly hurt an experienced guard is like summoning a furious aboar in human shrouding.

Every clan sends their nine most skilled warriors to Karvosti to become members of the Wrathguard. Nominations are made by the clan chieftains when one of their representatives falls in combat or – in singular cases – retires. He or she who is appointed can hardly say no, partly because the mission is regarded as one of the most honorable a clan warrior can be tasked with, partly because a rejection likely would mean exclusion from the clan or see the warrior branded as an outlaw. There are tales of barbarians who have been appointed to the Wrathguard after having left their clans, and therefore refused to serve. But it is also said that the defiance of these defectors always ends up costing them their lives, sooner or later…

### Wrathful Fury

In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a wrathful fury as a bonus action. While in this state, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing heavy armor:

- You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
- When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll. This bonus damage is equal to 1 + half of your proficiency bonus, rounded up.
- If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while in the wrathful fury.

Your wrath lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your wrath on your turn as a bonus action.

Once you have used your wrathful fury a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, you must finish a long or extended rest before you can use this feature again.

###  Blood Combat

At 2nd level, if you are in a wrath and current hit points are equal to half or less of your maximum hit points (rounded up), you have advantage on all your attack rolls.

At 3rd level, if you are in a wrath and current hit points are equal to half (rounded up) or less of your maximum hit points, you add your proficiency bonus to your damage rolls.

At 5th level, when you are in a wrath and you do damage to any enemy you recover hit points equal to half that damage, rounded down. When you recover hit points you cannot exceed your maximum hit point total.

### Relentless

At 7th level, your wrath can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you’re in a wrathful fury and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 5 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.

Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5.

When you finish a short or longer rest, the DC resets to 5.

### Champion of the Wild

At 9th level, you embody the power of the wilderness. Choose Strength or Constitution. Your chosen score increases by 4 and your maximum for that ability score is now 24.
