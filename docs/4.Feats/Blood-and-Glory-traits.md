Traits
Traits are the definitive features and abilities that a
Character will gain as they progress through the game.
Many Traits require certain Skill Ranks, Attribute
scores, or even other Traits to learn.
Characters gain a Trait after each Chapter. A
Character cannot have more than 1 2 Traits. If a
Character already has 1 2 Traits when they complete a
Chapter, they may replace a Trait with a new one, even
if the removed Trait is a prerequisite for another they
possess.
Traits grant access to both active and passive
bonuses. Benefits are persistent passive effects that may
modify Attributes, Skills, or other aspects of the game.
Many Traits also grant access to powerful Actions,
Reactions, and Desperate Actions (see pages 29-30).
