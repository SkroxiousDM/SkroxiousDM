# Burdens
## Addiction
- Bonus: +2 to an ability score (see below)
You have developed an addiction and must have a dose of your drug each day, or suffer from withdrawal symptoms. The drug (wine (Constitution), dream snuff (Wisdom), daft root (Strength) or similar drugs) costs one shilling per dose. An alchemist can create the drug for themselves or a friend for half that price.

Each day without the drug, you must also pass a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you will abandon all other projects and start hunting for the daily dose. Withdrawal symptoms give a level of exhaustion each day, with no non-­magical way to recover the exhaustion. After the fifth day, you begin to recover exhaustion as normal, and you become free of the drug once you have no exhaustion remaining. Once free, you only need to make the Wisdom saving throw once a month or on a triggering event (GM’s discretion).

## Bestial

- Bonus: +2 to Constitution

You have a bestial appearance, in the form of one (or a few) conspicuous traits – jakaar eyes, aboar tusks, lindworm scales on arms and neck, or something else arousing fear and disgust.

Concealing the traits requires you to pass a DC 10 Charisma saving throw. If the save is failed, you have disadvantage on all Charisma (Deception, Performance or Persuasion) checks. However, the bestial exterior grants advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks. As soon as they can, those subjected to your intimidation efforts – whether or not it is successful – will report you to the Town Watch (or similar authorities) as a suspected abomination.

## Bloodthirst

- Bonus: +2 to Strength

You have a thirst for blood, easily awoken and hard to quench. The thirst appears if you take damage and means that you will not spare any enemies – not even if they surrender. Trying to spare an enemy requires an almost overpowering effort; you must succeed at a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw.

## Code of Honor

- Bonus: +2 to Wisdom

You have adopted a very strict [[Code of Honour]], applicable in all situations but especially burdensome in combat. The code might specify that all opponents must be defeated, or that you never stand down from a fight or that every battle must be an honorable battle one on one. Work with your GM to determine the specifics.

## Dark Blood

- Bonus: +1 to two different ability scores of your choice, +2 to permanent Corruption

Dark blood flows through your veins, passed down from an ancestor, or as a result of being cursed. Maybe you were simply born in the wrong part of Davokar at the wrong time. The dark blood always comes with some effect, roll on the Marks of Corruption table on . The listed mark is permanent.

The character may acquire and develop the following monstrous traits by selecting them as feats: Natural Weapon, Armored, Robust, Regeneration, Wings. (See the Ruins of Symbaroum Bestiary for more information). You gain 2 additional points of permanent Corruption each time you gain a monstrous trait.

## Elderly

- Bonus: +2 to Wisdom

You are past your prime and have both good and bad days. If the first ability check of the day is a success, it is a good day and everything seems to be alright; if the first check of the day is a failure, it is a bad day – the gout sets in, all your joints are aching or you are out of breath even when seated. You have disadvantage on ability checks until you succeed at one, at which time this effect ends.

## Impulsive

- Bonus: +2 to Strength or Charisma

You act before thinking. This means that as soon as the player declares that the character does something, you act – and cannot have second thoughts. The only way for you to restrain yourself is to take a point of temporary Corruption as your internal conflict allows darkness to seep in.

## Nightmares

- Bonus: +2 to Constitution

You are haunted by nightmares each and every night, possibly because of something you have experienced, or for more abstruse reasons, such as an ominous omen or the consequence of a family curse. Each night, you must pass a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain a level of exhaustion.

## Mystical Mark

- Bonus: +2 to Charisma

You have a mystical mark somewhere on your body, maybe a birthmark or a scar gained later in life, that requires effort to conceal. Whatever the origin, you are at risk of being mistaken for having a blight-­mark. In situations when it is relevant, you must pass an opposed Charisma (Deception) versus Wisdom (Perception) roll or attract unwanted attention (which can take different forms depending on the situation).

## Seizures

- Bonus: +2 to Intelligence or Wisdom

You are afflicted by a sensitive mind, meaning that you can be exposed to violent cramps throughout the body when excited or stressed. If you roll a natural 1 on an ability check you become stunned for 1d4 turns. Afterwards you gain 1 level of exhaustion.

## Sickly

- Bonus: +2 to Wisdom

You suffer from a chronic disease, making you weak but also giving you insight into healing and your body’s structure. Normally, your weakness does not show, but when you must make death saving throws they are at disadvantage.

## Slow

- Bonus: +2 to Wisdom

You move at an unusually slow pace. Reduce your base speed by 10 feet, to a minimum of 10 feet.
