## I Fought, I Lived
###### Origin Feat
You confronted a horror from beyond this world or spawned by terrible magic. It disregarded you as a puny mortal, but it learned its mistake the hard way when you sent it back to wherever it came from with good, old-fashioned muscle,
courage, and a really, really large axe.

You gain the following benefits.

## I Hid from the Terror
###### Origin Feat
That night is a blur. A strange presence, an overwhelming terror, and a confused jumble of screams mixed with faint memories of something terrible and hungry.

## I Pierced the Illusion
###### Origin Feat
You came across something strange and awful, made all the more terrible by its hidden nature. A town might have seemed innocent until it dragged unwitting visitors to their carefully tended sacrificial garden, or the family that took you
in on a dark, stormy night were actually hungry cannibals. You survived because you saw their disguise and escaped or struck first.

You gain the following benefits.
- **Clear Senses**. If you have the Charmed condition at the start of your turn, roll a d20. On a 10 or higher, you no longer have that condition.

- **Subtle Interrogation**. You have advantage on Insight checks made against creatures that you are speaking with.

## I Opened the Gate
###### Origin Feat
You didn’t mean for things to turn out this way. You were curious and perhaps ignored a few signs, but it’s hard to take ancient curses seriously. Musty old books say a lot of things, and most of them turn out to be mere fables. Most of them. The one book you read turned out to be the key to unleashing some ancient evil. Now it’s in the world, and it’s up to you to find it and send it back.

You gain the following benefits.
- **Delver into Forgotten Lore**. You learn three languages of your choice.
- **Foul Arcana**. You can tap into a brief glimpse of the Yonder to empower a spell, at the cost of overwhelming your mind with a horrifying, cosmic insight. When you cast a spell, you can give that spell’s save DC a +2 bonus but you have the Paralyzed condition until the start of your next turn. You can use this benefit a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## I Survived to Tell the Tale

You gain the following benefits.
- **Instinct to Survive**. When you take damage that would reduce you to 0 hit points, you can immediately regain hit points
equal to your level. When you use this benefit, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.

- **Wriggle Free**. If you would gain the Grappled condition, roll a d20. On a 10 or higher, you instead do not gain it.

## A Dash of Magic  
Whether you learned this trick from a mentor, a tome, or observation, or whether it is an innate ability granted by your ancestry or some higher power, you can perform a dash of magic. How this magic appears depends on the origin of the ability. A magical creature might cast ray offrost as a breath weapon, or shocking grasp as a natural ability. Let your imagination set the limits, though be consistent once the origin and manifestation of this ability is chosen.<br>

## Natural Jumper
Are your legs made of springs? Perhaps. Most likely, you’re simply a highly evolved or highly trained jumper.<br>
• Your long jump and high jump distances are doubled.
