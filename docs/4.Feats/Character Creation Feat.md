# CHARACTER CREATION FEATS
You may choose any [[General Feats](https://skroxiousdm.github.io/SkroxiousDM/docs/4.Feats/General%20Feats)], [[Origin Feats](https://skroxiousdm.github.io/SkroxiousDM/docs/4.Feats/Origin%20Feats)] or [[Class Feats](https://skroxiousdm.github.io/SkroxiousDM/docs/4.Feats/Class%20Feats)] you qualify for instead of a Character Creation Feat.

## Climbing Adept  
Your character has been blessed with the supernatural ability to climb almost any surface. Perhaps you were raised by creatures dwelling among the trees, or on the faces of perilous cliffs and have learned special techniques and tools that allow you to scale most any obstacle. Or, perhaps this ability is the result of a blessing from some divine or eldritch being, or the result of magical contamination seeping into your body.<br>  
• Activating this ability takes 1 action. This ability lasts for 1 hour, and can only be used again after a long rest.  
• When this ability is active you gain a climbing speed equal to 15ft. This increases to 20ft at 5th level, and equal to your walking speed 12th level.  
• You can use the dash action to double your climbing speed for that turn.  

## Swimming Adept  
You were raised in an aquatic environment that allowed you to develop the ability to traverse aquatic environments like the creatures of the deep. Or, perhaps your parents or distant ancestors were creatures of the deep themselves, or you gained the blessing of a supernatural being tied to aquatic environments.<br>  
• Activating this ability takes 1 action. This ability lasts for 1 hour and can only be used again after a long rest.  
• When this ability is active you gain the ability to hold your breath for as long as the ability lasts.  
• When this ability is active you gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed. The duration of the ability increases to 8 hours at 5th level. At 12th level this ability is considered always active, and no longer requires resting.  
• You can use the dash action to double your swimming speed.  

## A Dash of Magic  
Whether you learned this trick from a mentor, a tome, or observation, or whether it is an innate ability granted by your ancestry or some higher power, you can perform a dash of magic. How this magic appears depends on the origin of the ability. A magical creature might cast ray offrost as a breath weapon, or shocking grasp as a natural ability. Let your imagination set the limits, though be consistent once the origin and manifestation of this ability is chosen.<br>
• You learn one cantrip from the Wizard spell list. Choose between Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability for this cantrip.
• This cantrip improves for you at 3rd, 6th, and 9th levels just as it would for a magic caster.

## Dangerous over short distances
You’ve become a natural sprinter, whether due to extensive training, your natural physiology, or adapting to extreme environments.<br>
• In combat, you can double your movement speed for one round.
• This ability refreshes after you have not moved for one round.

## Natural Resistance
You are able to withstand adverse conditions that would put other creatures into a fresh grave.<br>
• You gain resistance to one elemental damage of your choice from the following list: fire, cold, acid, lightning, or poison.

## Tough Hide
Whether due to a hyper-developed survival instinct or an altered anatomy that includes scales, horns, bony protrusions, or other means of natural defense, you’ve become very hard to hit.<br>
• You gain +1 to AC.

## Blind Sense
Either as a physiological response to total darkness, or advanced sensory training, you have developed the ability of limited Blind Sense.<br>
• At first level, you have 10ft. of Blind Sense. This increases to 15 ft. at 5th level, and 30 feet at 10th level.

## Haunted By a Past Life
Through deep meditation and connection to the cosmos, a freak magical accident, possession, or having been resurrected, you have a connection to a past life that haunts you.<br>
• At character creation, choose one additional Background. You gain all the benefits of this Background.

## Martial Training
Due to brutal military training or a martial upbringing you have become a proficient warrior.<br>
• You become proficient in one Fighting Style of your choice.

## Relentless Endurance
Due to physiological resilience, the result of merciless training, or supernatural willpower, you didn’t hear no bell.<br>
• Whenever an attack would bring you to 0 hp, you instead drop to 1 hp instead. You cannot use this ability again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Natural Jumper
Are your legs made of springs? Perhaps. Most likely, you’re simply a highly evolved or highly trained jumper.<br>
• Your long jump and high jump distances are doubled.


## I Fought, I Lived
###### Origin Feat
You confronted a horror from beyond this world or spawned by terrible magic. It disregarded you as a puny mortal, but it learned its mistake the hard way when you sent it back to wherever it came from with good, old-fashioned muscle,
courage, and a really, really large axe.

You gain the following benefits.
- **Defiant Strike**. While you are Bloodied and hit with a spell or weapon attack, you can choose to treat the attack’s damage roll as having rolled the maximum damage possible. Once you use this benefit, you can’t use it again until you
finish a long rest.
- **Indomitable Heart**. If you have the Frightened condition at the start of your turn, roll a d20. On a 10 or higher, you no longer have that condition.

## I Hid from the Terror
###### Origin Feat
That night is a blur. A strange presence, an overwhelming terror, and a confused jumble of screams mixed with faint memories of something terrible and hungry. You hid from it, finding a place too small for it to reach. The sounds of that night, and the awful aftermath you found that morning, will remain with you to the end of your days and beyond.

You gain the following benefits.
- **Shadowed Strike**. If attacking would end the Invisible condition on you, you can make an attack and keep that condition.
You can use this benefit a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.
- **Beneath Notice**. When you attempt to hide from a creature that is larger than you, you can hide if you are lightly obscured or more than 30 feet away from it. You gain the benefits of being hidden against such creatures, but you do not hide from other creatures.
- **Merge into Shadows**. Wisdom (Perception) checks made to detect you while you have the Invisible condition have disadvantage.

## I Pierced the Illusion
###### Origin Feat
You came across something strange and awful, made all the more terrible by its hidden nature. A town might have seemed innocent until it dragged unwitting visitors to their carefully tended sacrificial garden, or the family that took you
in on a dark, stormy night were actually hungry cannibals. You survived because you saw their disguise and escaped or struck first.

You gain the following benefits.
- **Clear Senses**. If you have the Charmed condition at the start of your turn, roll a d20. On a 10 or higher, you no longer have that condition.
- **Ear for Falsehood**. When an NPC speaks to you, you can use this ability to determine if they are lying. You learn nothing about the truth they conceal or why they are lying, simply that there is a knowing falsehood in their statement. You can use this benefit a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.
- **Subtle Interrogation**. You have advantage on Insight checks made against creatures that you are speaking with.

## I Opened the Gate
###### Origin Feat
You didn’t mean for things to turn out this way. You were curious and perhaps ignored a few signs, but it’s hard to take ancient curses seriously. Musty old books say a lot of things, and most of them turn out to be mere fables. Most of them. The one book you read turned out to be the key to unleashing some ancient evil. Now it’s in the world, and it’s up to you to find it and send it back.

You gain the following benefits.
- **Delver into Forgotten Lore**. You learn three languages of your choice.
- **Foul Arcana**. You can tap into a brief glimpse of the Yonder to empower a spell, at the cost of overwhelming your mind with a horrifying, cosmic insight. When you cast a spell, you can give that spell’s save DC a +2 bonus but you have the Paralyzed condition until the start of your next turn. You can use this benefit a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## I Survived to Tell the Tale
###### Origin Feat
You encountered something dreadful, a horrible creature or bizarre ritual that set you down the path to becoming an investigator of the strange. Your quick feet and instinct for survival carried you through that day and are your best asset.

You gain the following benefits.
- **Instinct to Survive**. When you take damage that would reduce you to 0 hit points, you can immediately regain hit points
equal to your level. When you use this benefit, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.
- **Superior Speed**. You gain a +10 bonus to speed.
- **Wriggle Free**. If you would gain the Grappled condition, roll a d20. On a 10 or higher, you instead do not gain it.
