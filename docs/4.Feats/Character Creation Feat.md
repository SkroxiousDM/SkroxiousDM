# CHARACTER CREATION FEATS
You may choose any [[General Feats](https://skroxiousdm.github.io/SkroxiousDM/docs/4.Feats/General%20Feats)], [[Origin Feats](https://skroxiousdm.github.io/SkroxiousDM/docs/4.Feats/Origin%20Feats)] or [[Class Feats](https://skroxiousdm.github.io/SkroxiousDM/docs/4.Feats/Class%20Feats)] you qualify for instead of a Character Creation Feat.

## Climbing Adept  
Your character has been blessed with the supernatural ability to climb almost any surface. Perhaps you were raised by creatures dwelling among the trees, or on the faces of perilous cliffs and have learned special techniques and tools that allow you to scale most any obstacle. Or, perhaps this ability is the result of a blessing from some divine or eldritch being, or the result of magical contamination seeping into your body.<br>  
• Activating this ability takes 1 action. This ability lasts for 1 hour, and can only be used again after a long rest.  
• When this ability is active you gain a climbing speed equal to 15ft. This increases to 20ft at 5th level, and equal to your walking speed 12th level.  
• You can use the dash action to double your climbing speed for that turn.  

## Swimming Adept  
You were raised in an aquatic environment that allowed you to develop the ability to traverse aquatic environments like the creatures of the deep. Or, perhaps your parents or distant ancestors were creatures of the deep themselves, or you gained the blessing of a supernatural being tied to aquatic environments.<br>  
• Activating this ability takes 1 action. This ability lasts for 1 hour and can only be used again after a long rest.  
• When this ability is active you gain the ability to hold your breath for as long as the ability lasts.  
• When this ability is active you gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed. The duration of the ability increases to 8 hours at 5th level. At 12th level this ability is considered always active, and no longer requires resting.  
• You can use the dash action to double your swimming speed.  

## A Dash of Magic  
Whether you learned this trick from a mentor, a tome, or observation, or whether it is an innate ability granted by your ancestry or some higher power, you can perform a dash of magic. How this magic appears depends on the origin of the ability. A magical creature might cast ray offrost as a breath weapon, or shocking grasp as a natural ability. Let your imagination set the limits, though be consistent once the origin and manifestation of this ability is chosen.<br>
• You learn one cantrip from the Wizard spell list. Choose between Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability for this cantrip.
• This cantrip improves for you at 3rd, 6th, and 9th levels just as it would for a magic caster.

## Dangerous over short distances
You’ve become a natural sprinter, whether due to extensive training, your natural physiology, or adapting to extreme environments.<br>
• In combat, you can double your movement speed for one round.
• This ability refreshes after you have not moved for one round.

## Natural Resistance
You are able to withstand adverse conditions that would put other creatures into a fresh grave.<br>
• You gain resistance to one elemental damage of your choice from the following list: fire, cold, acid, lightning, or poison.

## Tough Hide
Whether due to a hyper-developed survival instinct or an altered anatomy that includes scales, horns, bony protrusions, or other means of natural defense, you’ve become very hard to hit.<br>
• You gain +1 to AC.

## Blind Sense
Either as a physiological response to total darkness, or advanced sensory training, you have developed the ability of limited Blind Sense.<br>
• At first level, you have 10ft. of Blind Sense. This increases to 15 ft. at 5th level, and 30 feet at 10th level.

## Haunted By a Past Life
Through deep meditation and connection to the cosmos, a freak magical accident, possession, or having been resurrected, you have a connection to a past life that haunts you.<br>
• At character creation, choose one additional Background. You gain all the benefits of this Background.

## Martial Training
Due to brutal military training or a martial upbringing you have become a proficient warrior.<br>
• You become proficient in one Fighting Style of your choice.

## Relentless Endurance
Due to physiological resilience, the result of merciless training, or supernatural willpower, you didn’t hear no bell.<br>
• Whenever an attack would bring you to 0 hp, you instead drop to 1 hp instead. You cannot use this ability again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Natural Jumper
Are your legs made of springs? Perhaps. Most likely, you’re simply a highly evolved or highly trained jumper.<br>
• Your long jump and high jump distances are doubled.
