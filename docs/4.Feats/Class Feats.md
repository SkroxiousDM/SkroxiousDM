### Confessor

- Prerequisite: You have taken the Theurg approach and attained at least 6th level in the mystic class. You cannot take both the Confessor and Inquisitor feats.

Some theurgs regard themselves as herdsmen of the people, as missionaries and healers. These Confessors primarily work to enforce that which is good, keeping the flickering light of Prios alive by providing it with fuel. They are often found in leading positions, within or outside the Church, in order to reach as many people as possible when working to spread light and truth. Many of the highest leaders and greatest theurgs in the Church of Prios wander the road of the Confessor. You gain the following benefits:

You learn the following rituals: lifegiver, exorcism, atonement. You gain only 3 permanent Corruption for these rituals and do not gain any Corruption when you cast them.

### Dedicated Focus

- Prerequisite: Your spellcasting ability score must be 13 or higher.

Choose one of the schools of magic (abjuration, conjuration, divination, enchantment, evocation, illusion, necromancy or transmutation). When you learn a spell of the chosen school you can learn a spell of the same school that is the same level or lower.

### Demonologist

- Prerequisite: You have taken the Sorcerer approach and attained at least 4th level in the mystic class.

Beyond the world – or between worlds, if one believes in the existence of multiple worlds – lays the Yonderworld. In the Yonderworld soul-­eating creatures roam, indistinguishable from abominations to the common man. Sorcerers appreciate the likeness, but call them “daemons” in acknowledgment of their differing origins. The daemons can be forced, lured or invited into the physical world by those who know of passages between the worlds.

You learn the following ritual: summon daemon. You gain only 1 permanent Corruption for this ritual and do not gain Corruption when you cast it at the basic option (see Summon Daemon).

The History of Demonology

Many demonologists regard their trade as vastly different from that of other sorcerers. In essence, they see themselves as explorers, seekers of the truth, and as more advanced compared to mossy Wizards who are satisfied poking around in the soil of the “Here-­and-­Now.” Sadly, they will likely never gain the admiration and respect they think they deserve.

According to many legends, the demonologists of the past invited Corruption into the world, precisely because they were scratching and tearing at the world’s fabric. Later stories blame them for having destroyed the once so lush realm of the Dark Lords, Lyastra. If anything, the demonologists will always be seen as the worst kind of sorcerers.

### Extensive Learning

- Prerequisite: Your spellcasting ability score must be 13 or higher.

Choose four spells on your spell list that are equal to or lower than your maximum spell level. You learn those spells. You can take this feat more than once, learning four new spells each time.

### Inquisitor

- Prerequisite: You have taken the Theurg approach and attained at least 6th level in the mystic class. You cannot take both the Confessor and Inquisitor feats.

For some theurgs, whether among priests or Black Cloaks, the hatred of the dark is so strong that they choose the inquisitor’s road: to seek out and destroy the enemies of Prios. Inquisitors are happy to cooperate with Templars and other members of the Church; they are not interested in understanding the darkness and tend to rely on cunning, ambushes and assassination to reach their goals, never brute force like the Templars.

To most inquisitors, sorcerers and their followers have no right to exist, and for that reason no moral consideration is necessary when they are fighting the dark.

You learn the following rituals: holy smoke, anathema, purgatory. You gain only 3 permanent Corruption for these rituals and do not gain any Corruption when you cast them.

### Necromancer

- Prerequisite: You have taken the Sorcerer approach and attained at least 5th level in the mystic class.

The Spirit World is the outer realm of the world, where the dead journey towards their final rest – if they are not disturbed by a necromancer on the way. Necromancers can force the spirits of the outer realm to return, in order to relay their secrets or to occupy a dead body and serve the death mage as a dragoul or some other undead being. An understanding of the mechanics of death also gives the necromancer access to ghastly powers and rituals.

You learn the rituals [[spirit walk]], animate dead, commune with spirits. You gain only 3 permanent Corruption for these rituals and do not gain any Corruption when you cast them.

### Pyromancer

- Prerequisite: You have taken the Wizard approach and attained at least 5th level in the mystic class.

For pyromancers, the element of fire has a special allure. By studying the essence of fire, the pyromancer learns to master the exothermic principle to such a degree that fire is transformed into an ally and a shelter, rather than being a dangerous element.

You learn the following rituals: tale of ashes, flaming servant, fire soul. You gain only 3 permanent Corruption for these rituals and do not gain any Corruption when you cast them.

### Secrets of the Order

- Prerequisite: You have taken the Staff Mage approach and attained at least 4th level in the mystic class.

Deep within Davokar, ruined monasteries contain secrets practiced for generations. These mysteries are taught to those trusted by the order, or to its members who have achieved much in their battle against Corruption. With knowledge of these secrets a Staff Mage truly becomes one with their staff.

You gain the following three abilities:

- Mastery. Twice per day you may invoke your mastery over your staff by using an action to magically fix it in place. Until you spend an action to release the staff it will not move, even if it is defying gravity. Whilst under this effect the staff may hold up to 8,000 lbs of weight. More weight than this causes the staff to release and fall. A creature can make a DC 30 strength check, moving the staff 10 ft. on a success. You must be able to see your staff and be within 100 ft. of it to be able to activate this feature.
- Unity. As a bonus action you may fuse your staff with your own body, drawing it into yourself. Whilst fused in this manner the staff weighs nothing and cannot be detected or discovered by other creatures. As another bonus action you call forth your staff causing it to grow from your palm ready to be used. After the first hour of being fused with you, any permanent Corruption begins to be drawn to you. At the end of the second hour the staff loses a point of permanent Corruption and you gain that point. This effect continues each hour until the staff has no permanent Corruption left.
- Strength. You draw vigor from wielding your staff, whilst you are touching your staff you have advantage on saving throws against poison and diseases. In addition, while you are wielding your staff as a weapon, you have advantage on ability checks to resist being pushed or knocked prone.

# SCOUNDREL

You are a master of stealth and thievery. You might focus on being flexible and fast, or disappearing into darkness or surprising folks in combat.

### Nimble

- Prerequisite: Dexterity 13 or higher.

You are extraordinarily dexterous:

- Your base speed increases by 10 feet.
- You can make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check instead of a Strength (Athletics) check to climb surfaces.
- If you suffer falling damage, you can make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a success you take half damage from the fall.

### Shadow Walker

- Prerequisite: Dexterity 13 or higher.

You are an expert at stealth. You gain the following benefits:

- You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you are obscured from any observers.
- If you are hidden, a failed attack roll does not reveal your location.

### Skirmish Expert

You have trained extensively in close-­in spontaneous combat. You gain a number of Skirmish dice (d6s) equal to your proficiency bonus. When it is your turn, if you are unarmed or are using an improvised weapon, you can use a bonus action to add a Skirmish die to your attack roll or damage roll.

You regain any spent Skirmish dice when you take a short or longer rest.

# WARRIOR

As a master of weapons and strength, you might learn to bring your full weight and strength against your enemy, to hold them steady and prevent them from hurting others or to wield your weapon with deadly grace.

### Bull Rush

- Prerequisite: Strength 13 or higher.

If you move 20 feet or more towards a target that is at least 20 feet away you have advantage on attack rolls (including shove checks) until the end of your turn.

### Melee Expert
