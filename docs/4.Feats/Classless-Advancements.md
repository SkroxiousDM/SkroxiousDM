You've done some studying outside your discipline, and sometimes you just happen to know some very unusual niche information.
No Action Cost - Self - 1/Short Rest
When you are about to roll an arcana, history, nature, or religion check, you can instead roll any one of the other skills from that list.

### Secondary Domain
Class Feat
Prerequisite: Cleric Level 4
Your faith is multifaceted, allowing you to draw on holy rituals of a greater variety than some clerics.
Choose a Divine Domain you did not choose at level 1. You learn the Channel Divinity option that clerics of this domain normally learn at level 3. If there are more than one for your chosen domain, pick one.

### Spell Trap
Prerequisite: Level 4 and Proficiency with Calligraphy Tools
You can create magical spell traps, storing spells to trigger at a later time.
To create a spell trap, follow the normal rules for scroll scribing, consuming the normal component costs. Instead of creating a scroll, you create a spell trap: a glyph that triggers the spell's effects under specific circumstances.
You must choose a spell that targets either a single creature or an area of effect.
1 Hour - 10 ft. Cube (5 ft.) - Magical - Permanent
The spell trap glyph can be as large as a 10 ft. cube. You inscribe the writing on a surface (which could be the inside of a book or container). If the spell trap is somehow moved 5 ft. or more, it is either triggered or harmlessly dispelled (you choose when creating the spell trap).
You set a condition for the trap to trigger (such as a chest being opened, or at least two undead being within 10 ft. of the trap) You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password. Once a trap is triggered, is is destroyed and the spell you inscribed begins.
When the trap is triggered, the spell inscribed in the spell trap is cast on the triggering creature, centered on the triggering creature, or otherwise positioned at the GM's discretion to be as close as possible to the trigger.
If you create a spell trap using a spell that requires &reference[concentration], the spell trap effectively maintains its own concentration, but if the creator of the trap takes any damage while the trap is active, the spell's concentration is broken.
While otherwise permanent, spell traps can be dispelled as if they were the spell that was placed in the trap.

Prerequisite: Proficiency in Investigation
You spend time researching a subject, allowing you to gain some information before you're next in danger.
During a Short or Long Rest - Self

    - Something you could have pieced together yourself with information you've seen,
    - Something recorded in written records you have access to,
    - Or something you could learn from a nearby creature.
If the information you seek isn't something you could learn right now, or you need proof to confirm the information, the GM can choose to instead tell you where to go to find the answer you seek. If the answer doesn't exist, or you can't possibly find it, the GM can tell you your research is inconclusive.
