The following feats generally provide limited benefits for a specific situation, or might allow a character to do something that would otherwise be impossible. Many feats provide a bonus, increasing one of your ability scores by 1 as well.

# Absolute Memory

- Bonus: +1 to Intelligence
- Restriction: Dwarves cannot take this feat (they have it as part of their origin already)

You come from a culture or tradition that does not use writing, but which instead has developed memory techniques to preserve and transmit vital knowledge. You remember everything seen or heard, which means that the player may ask the Game­master about details perceived by the player character during their past adventures. The Game­master must answer as thoroughly as possible.

# Archivist

- Bonus: +1 to Intelligence

You are trained to organize and search for information. You gain advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks when researching in archives and libraries.

# Augur

- Bonus: +1 to Wisdom

You have always seen signs others have missed, and easily conduct rituals dealing with fate or hidden information. When you learn a divination spell as a ritual you gain one less permanent Corruption than normal, to a minimum of 1 permanent Corruption.

# Beast Tongue

- Bonus: +1 to Wisdom

You can speak to creatures from the monster category Beasts. Beasts have their limitations but can answer questions about which creatures are in, or have traveled through, an area, and also estimate their numbers (one, two or many). The beasts do not perform any services; they talk to you as equals.

# Bloodhound

- Bonus: +1 to Wisdom

You have a developed sense for finding people, no matter if the traces of their presence are found on the ground, in a lair or among discovered belongings. You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception or Survival) checks when pursuing a specific individual.

# Blood Ties

- Bonus: +1 to an ability score of your choice.

You have established a mystical blood tie to a creature of a different origin. Because of this link, you can later on choose a feat belonging to the origin of the blood-­friend (see 01.4i - Origin Feats). It is most likely that the blood tie of the character is linked to another cultural origin, but beasts and other creatures are a possibility. The story of how the character came to enter into the relationship is probably interesting and telling of your life history, and maybe also of your morals and worldviews.

# Cat Burglar

- Bonus: +1 to Dexterity

You are trained to open locks, latches and bolts, and disarm traps. You are proficient with thieves’ tools.

# Commanding Voice

- Bonus: +1 to Charisma

You have a well-­tuned and loud voice, able to rise above the clamor of combat. As a bonus action, you can allow any allies within 60 feet of you that can hear you to gain advantage on Charisma saving throws until the start of your next turn. You do not gain advantage yourself.

# Con Artist

- Bonus: +1 to Wisdom or Charisma (your choice)

You have been trained to quickly twist the truth, and to generalize or exaggerate when it is called for. You have advantage on both Charisma (Deception) and Wisdom (Insight) checks regarding lies; hence, both for making a lie and noticing when others are lying. The lie’s veracity is usually found out quickly, so the liar must hurry if they are to take advantage of it.

# Double-­tongue

- Bonus: +1 to Charisma

Double-­tongue is a language developed by the Thieves Guild in Yndaros – you say one thing but mean another. This way, sensitive conversations can be held within earshot of outsiders. If multiple characters know Double-­tongue, they can speak about secrets without risk – provided that the bystanders do not know the language as well…

# Enduring March

- Bonus: +1 to Constitution

After having marched many, many miles in military columns or through the wilds, you have advantage on Constitution saving throws during forced marches (see Forced Marches and Rides ).

# Escape Artist

- Bonus: +1 to Dexterity

You have loose joints and have been trained to utilize this in order to get free from bonds or squeeze through narrow passages. You can also get free from the clutches of an enemy or out of traps such as nets and snares. In all these cases, you have advantage on the escape attempt.

# Fire Forged

- Bonus: +1 to Constitution

You were born beneath a glowing celestial phenomenon or were the only one to survive a devastating fire. You are resistant to fire damage.

# Fleet-­footed

- Bonus: +1 to Strength

You can move at an unusually high speed. You can use your bonus action to Dash.

# Forceful Personality

- Bonus: +1 to Charisma

You know how to be threatening in an effective way and can scare people into acting according to your will, if only for a short while. You have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) checks pertaining to threats, interrogation and coercion. The effect is momentary; later the victim will likely retaliate against you when a chance presents itself.

# Green Thumb

- Bonus: +1 to Wisdom

The character has a mystical connection to all growing things and has advantage on Wisdom(Survival) checks related to challenges in the wilds, such as orienting in the woods and finding food and shelter.

# Impressionist

- Bonus: +1 to Charisma

You are a skilled impressionist, whether trying to impersonate a type of person belonging to your origin or imitating a specific individual. You gain advantage on Intelligence or Charisma checks when trying to impersonate a type of person (for instance a town guardsman) rather than a specific individual. If you have a disguise kit then you have advantage on impersonating a specific individual that shares your origin. If you are impersonating a type of person from a different origin then you have disadvantage on the check; impersonating a specific individual of a different origin is almost always impossible.

# Manipulator

- Bonus: +1 to Charisma

You know how to manipulate others, using flattery, threats, or a combination thereof. It takes time to influence someone; it requires a scene of emotional manipulations to achieve the intended effect. Once you’ve chosen a victim, you have advantage on Charisma checks for that manipulation. On the other hand, the influence lasts longer than when simply lying – the victim accepts the sentiments as its own and will defend them long after the manipulator has left the place.

# Medium

You grew up in the presence of ghosts and have developed a connection to the realm of spirits. You have advantage on saving throws and ability checks regarding the spirits or the spirit world.

# Mirage

You have a mystical gift and may weave momentary mirages from thin air; flames that emit no heat jump between your hands, tiny figures of light dance in the air, and so on. You can also weave false images over smaller objects, for instance making pebbles appear as shining coins. You can cast prestidigitation without gaining any Corruption.

With Mirage, you may make an opposed check – your Charisma (Deception) vs their Wisdom (Insight) to dupe someone into accepting fake goods or payment in the form of illusory coins, to a maximum “value” of a hundred thaler. Also, Mirage can grant advantage on a Charisma check when you threaten someone with “powerful magic.”

# Pathfinder

- Bonus: +1 to Wisdom

You have well-­tuned senses for spotting and following tracks, both below ground and on the surface. You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks when trying to follow a trail or find the way to, or back from, a place.

You can carry equipment weighing up to 20 times your Strength score in pounds (9 times your Strength score in kilograms).

# Poison Resilient

- Bonus: +1 to Constitution

By carefully exposing yourself to toxins, you have built up a remarkable resilience. You have resistance to poison damage and advantage on saving throws to avoid the poisoned condition.

# Shadow Spawn

- Bonus: +1 to Dexterity

You were born during a solar eclipse and ever since then shadows are drawn to you. You have advantage on any Dexterity checks when sneaking or hiding.

# Soulmate

You have a soulmate, either in the romantic or familial sense. Irrespective of which, you may telepathically communicate simple messages and feelings to your counterpart. You always know approximately where the other person is and if they are in any kind of trouble. The counterpart may be a non-­player character important to the game or the character of another player; talk to your gaming friends and decide what is best. In the latter case, it is enough that one of the characters acquires the boon in question. If the soulmate perishes then after a period of grieving you can gain +2 to an ability score of your choice as you redirect your energies.

# Storyteller

- Bonus: +1 to Charisma

You are a gifted storyteller and no matter if you narrate legends, religious myths or burlesque tales, you will impress the audience. You gain advantage on Charisma (Deception or Performance) checks when attempting to weave a credible story to impress your listeners, and you are skilled enough to earn an income from your performances (see Downtime).

Your training with a lance while mounted has given you mastery of the weapon, making you deadly against foes while charging.

If your mount first moves more than 10ft you can ride down opponents who are one size category smaller than your mount or smaller. When entering an enemy space, the mount's speed is reduced by half. Any enemy caught in the path can make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check vs. the mount's Strength (Athletics). The mount rolls with advantage. If the mount wins, the enemy is shoved up to 10 feet, takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage, and is knocked prone. The mount can ride down up to three creatures this way.
