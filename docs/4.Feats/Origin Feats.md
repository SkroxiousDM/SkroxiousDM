Origin Feats

There are certain features that you might inherit because of your origin. In many cases, you might have always had the potential for this feature but only just begun to concentrate on developing and using it reliably in recent days.

CHANGELINGS

Some changelings retain the ability to disguise themselves magically.

Change Self

You transform your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can make yourself appear as a member of another origin, though none of your statistics change. You can only appear as a creature of the same size category as you, and your basic shape stays the same; you can't use this effect to become quadrupedal, for instance. The effect ends at dawn, but you can use this effect again after a short or longer rest, so that you can continue the disguise as needed. Suspicious folk might reveal the truth by making a Wisdom (Insight) vs Charisma (Deception) check.

DWARVES

All dwarves hold grudges, but for some, the anger can manifest in a magical revenge against their enemies.

Retribution

When you are in danger, you can speak a word of power as a reaction and select an enemy creature within 30 feet that can hear you. For the next minute, whenever you take damage from the chosen enemy, it is divided in half and assigned both to you and that enemy (you take the additional point if the damage amount is odd). After the effect ends, you must take an extended rest before using this feature again.

GOBLINS

Despite their small stature goblins can endure a tremendous amount of pain.

Tough and Stringy

When rolling hit points for a new level, if you receive less than the average (4) you can reroll the Hit Die. You must use the new value. If using the average value, use 5 on even levels and 4 on odd.

HUMANS

Some humans have the ability to see the shadows of creatures and people, if they concentrate upon them.

Shadow-­sight

Some humans are sensitive to the ethereal echoes of Shadows and, when concentrating, can see them. If you take this feat, you can spend a bonus action and take 1d4 temporary Corruption to discern a creature’s Shadow, and judge it to be normal, blight-­stricken, blight-­marked or thoroughly corrupt (see [[Corruption and Shadow]]).

The Game­master will compare your passive Insight to the target’s passive Deception. If you fail, you see the creature’s normal shadow, as it looked before suffering any corrupting influences.

OGRES

While ogres tend to be smaller than their cousins the trolls, they are mere inches away from qualifying as Large creatures.

Big-­boned

- Bonus: +1 to your Strength modifier.

You are just at the edge of Medium size and have more muscle mass than most creatures your size. When determining your carrying capacity and lifting capacity you count as Large (double the amount a Medium creature can carry or lift). You also count as being Large when creatures try to grapple you.

CHARACTER CREATION FEATS

Climbing Adept  
Your character has been blessed with the supernatural ability to climb almost any surface. Perhaps you were raised by creatures dwelling among the trees, or on the faces of perilous cliffs and have learned special techniques and tools that allow you to scale most any obstacle. Or, perhaps this ability is the result of a blessing from some divine or eldritch being, or the result of magical  
contamination seeping into your body.  
• Activating this ability takes 1 action. This  
ability lasts for 1 hour, and can only be used  
again after a long rest.  
• When this ability is active you gain a  
climbing speed equal to 15ft. This increases  
to 20ft at 5th level, and equal to your  
walking speed 12th level.  
• You can use the dash action to double your  
climbing speed for that turn.  

Swimming Adept  
You were raised in an aquatic environment that allowed you to develop the ability to traverse aquatic environments like the creatures of the deep. Or, perhaps your parents or distant ancestors were creatures of the deep themselves, or you gained the blessing of a supernatural being tied to aquatic environments.  
• Activating this ability takes 1 action. This  
ability lasts for 1 hour and can only be used  
again after a long rest.  
• When this ability is active you gain the  
ability to hold your breath for as long as the  
ability lasts.  
• When this ability is active you gain a  
swimming speed equal to your walking  
speed. The duration of the ability increases  
to 8 hours at 5th level. At 12th level this  
ability is considered always active, and no  
longer requires resting.  
• You can use the dash action to double your  
swimming speed.  

A Dash of Magic  
Whether you learned this trick from a mentor,  
a tome, or observation, or whether it is an innate ability granted by your ancestry or some higher power, you can perform a dash of magic. How this magic appears depends on the origin of the ability. A magical creature might cast ray offrost as a breath weapon, or shocking grasp as a natural ability. Let your imagination set the limits, though be consistent once the origin and manifestation of this ability is chosen.

• You learn one cantrip from the Wizard spell list. Choose between Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability for this cantrip.

• This cantrip improves for you at 5th, 11th, and 17th levels just as it would for a magic caster.

Dangerous over short distances

You’ve become a natural sprinter, whether due to extensive training, your natural physiology, or adapting to extreme environments.

• In combat, you can double your movement speed for one round.

• This ability refreshes after you have not moved for one round.

Natural Resistance

You are able to withstand adverse conditions that would put other creatures into a fresh grave.

• You gain resistance to one elemental damage of your choice from the following list: fire, cold, acid, lightning, or poison.

Tough Hide

Whether due to a hyper-developed survival instinct or an altered anatomy that includes scales, horns, bony protrusions, or other means of natural defense, you’ve become very hard to hit.

• You gain +1 to AC.

Blind Sense

Either as a physiological response to total darkness, or advanced sensory training, you have developed the ability of limited Blind Sense.

• At first level, you have 10ft. of Blind Sense. This increases to 15 ft. at 5th level, and 30 feet at 10th level.

Haunted By a Past Life

Through deep meditation and connection to the cosmos, a freak magical accident, possession, or having been resurrected, you have a connection to a past life that haunts you.

• At character creation, choose one additional Background. You gain all the benefits of this Background.

Martial Training

Due to brutal military training or a martial upbringing you have become a proficient warrior.

• You become proficient in one Fighting Style of your choice.

Relentless Endurance

Due to physiological resilience, the result of merciless training, or supernatural willpower, you didn’t hear no bell.

• Whenever an attack would bring you to 0 hp, you instead drop to 1 hp instead. You cannot use this ability again until you finish a short or long rest.

Natural Jumper

Are your legs made of springs? Perhaps. Most likely, you’re simply a highly evolved or highly trained jumper.

Your long jump and high jump distances are doubled.
