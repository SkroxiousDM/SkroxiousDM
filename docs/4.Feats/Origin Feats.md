Origin Feats

There are certain features that you might inherit because of your origin. In many cases, you might have always had the potential for this feature but only just begun to concentrate on developing and using it reliably in recent days.

CHANGELINGS

Some changelings retain the ability to disguise themselves magically.

Change Self

You transform your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can make yourself appear as a member of another origin, though none of your statistics change. You can only appear as a creature of the same size category as you, and your basic shape stays the same; you can't use this effect to become quadrupedal, for instance. The effect ends at dawn, but you can use this effect again after a short or longer rest, so that you can continue the disguise as needed. Suspicious folk might reveal the truth by making a Wisdom (Insight) vs Charisma (Deception) check.

DWARVES

All dwarves hold grudges, but for some, the anger can manifest in a magical revenge against their enemies.

Retribution

When you are in danger, you can speak a word of power as a reaction and select an enemy creature within 30 feet that can hear you. For the next minute, whenever you take damage from the chosen enemy, it is divided in half and assigned both to you and that enemy (you take the additional point if the damage amount is odd). After the effect ends, you must take an extended rest before using this feature again.

GOBLINS

Despite their small stature goblins can endure a tremendous amount of pain.

Tough and Stringy

When rolling hit points for a new level, if you receive less than the average (4) you can reroll the Hit Die. You must use the new value. If using the average value, use 5 on even levels and 4 on odd.

HUMANS

Some humans have the ability to see the shadows of creatures and people, if they concentrate upon them.

Shadow-­sight

Some humans are sensitive to the ethereal echoes of Shadows and, when concentrating, can see them. If you take this feat, you can spend a bonus action and take 1d4 temporary Corruption to discern a creature’s Shadow, and judge it to be normal, blight-­stricken, blight-­marked or thoroughly corrupt (see [[Corruption & Shadow]]).

The Game­master will compare your passive Insight to the target’s passive Deception. If you fail, you see the creature’s normal shadow, as it looked before suffering any corrupting influences.

OGRES

While ogres tend to be smaller than their cousins the trolls, they are mere inches away from qualifying as Large creatures.

Big-­boned

- Bonus: +1 to your Strength modifier.

You are just at the edge of Medium size and have more muscle mass than most creatures your size. When determining your carrying capacity and lifting capacity you count as Large (double the amount a Medium creature can carry or lift). You also count as being Large when creatures try to grapple you.
