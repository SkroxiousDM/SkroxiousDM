THE PEOPLES OF the Davokar region possess a vast knowledge of how to transform herbs, fruits and the bodily organs of animals into useful elixirs. Among the barbarians it is usually the witches who create the elixirs, while Ambrian decoctions are often made b y specialized craftsmen and artisans.

The exchange of knowledge between alchemists in Ambria and Davokar causes ever more elixirs to become available to the Ambrians. Some drugs can only be purchased on the black market in places like Thistle Hold, since they are illegal or at least so inappropriate that selling (or buying) them will attract attention from the authorities and witch hunters. Among these are most elixirs that give Corruption; both Ambrians and barbarians handle the trade in such decoctions discreetly.

Finding a specific elixir on the black market in Ambria requires a DC 13 Charisma check by someone who has contacts in the black market (most Scoundrels, some Hunters or anyone with the Unusual Contacts feat). Alternatively, someone with Alchemist’s Supplies can brew elixirs in civilization; if they also have a Field Laboratory they can do so in the wilderness. Supplies cost half the market value of the elixir or require 1 downtime day of gathering.

The table below gives the DC to produce the elixir. If the elixir provides a numerical effect this is also given. A slash (/) indicates a choice between effects, which will be explained in the elixir’s entry below. Consuming an elixir is usually an object interaction, but the GM may require an action instead, depending on the location of the elixir and external factors. The chart also provides an average sale cost and likely number of elixirs available.

† This is the minimum DC, if you set a higher DC to make the elixir that higher DC is also used to save against the elixir’s effect.||

#### Antidote.
This elixir provides a bonus to the next saving throw within 24 hours that a character makes against a poison effect. While it helps stop the poison, it does not cure any damage the creature has already sustained due to the poison. For each level the DC to create the elixir and the bonus to the saving throw are given.
#### Antidote Candle.
When lit, this candle emits fumes that work as an antidote on all around it. Everyone affected receives a bonus to their next saving throw within 24 hours against poison. Note this does not affect damage already suffered.
#### Choking Spores.
This elixir is produced from Davokar’s lichens and mushrooms. When applied to a garrote, a choking victim becomes unconscious one round sooner than normal (they always get at least one round to attempt to escape the garrote).
#### Concentrated Magic.
A dose of mystical essence, which allows a mystic to reduce the temporary Corruption gain from casting a spell by 1 point (minimum of 1 point of temporary Corruption). Only one can be consumed per casting and the mystic must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the end of their next turn.
#### Drone Dew.
This is a liquid elixir made from drone spores, also containing accelerants. A living creature who ingests a dose of the elixir immediately must make a Constitution saving throw, falling unconscious on a failure or becoming stunned for one round on a success.
#### Elemental Essence.
If you apply a dose of elemental essence then either one melee weapon, four throwing weapons or all the arrows/bolts in a quiver deal an additional 1d4 elemental damage for 1 minute. The alchemist must choose which element to prepare: fire, cold, acid or lightning.
#### Elixir of Life.
Consuming an Elixir of Life gives the drinker regenerative powers. You regain 1 recovery die when you drink this potion. Sadly the character also suffers 1 temporary Corruption
#### Eye Drops
These drops will immediately return the gift of sight to a temporarily blinded creature.
#### Fire Dye.
Fire dye consists of salts that change the color of any fire they are cast into. If the colors are ascribed a specific meaning known to the user and an allied observer it can be used for signaling over long distances. They are also used for entertainment among the wealthy, and by charlatans to impress commoners.
### Flash Powder.
A finely grained powder that emits a blinding light when thrown (range 30/90). Creatures within 5 feet of the effect must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded until the end of their next turn.
#### Ghost Candle.
The fumes from this candle make visible all invisible objects and creatures within a 30-foot radius..
#### Herbal Cure.
An herbal cure consists of an alchemical poultice coupled with bandages. It smells vile but heals 1d4 hit points. A user must take a short or longer rest between doses.
#### Holy Water.
This water, instilled with the light of Prios, can heal wounds and sooth souls. It heals 2d4 + 2 hit points and reduces temporary Corruption by 1 point.
#### Homing Arrow.
The alchemist marinates an arrow in homing essences, thereby creating an arrow that flies past other combatants, i.e. it does not require a clear line of sight and ignores cover effects. However, the archer must be able to see some portion of the target and must succeed at a regular attack roll to successfully hit it.
#### Homunculus.
A seed is planted and one day later a miniature servant sprouts from the ground. The homunculus is Tiny, has no skills or features and all of its ability scores are 10 (+0). It serves its maker loyally then withers away after a month; all it leaves behind is a pile of dirt. Creating a homunculus is a true violation of the natural order, meaning that the one using the seed suffers 1d6 temporary Corruption.
#### Poison.
The DC for the poison is dependent on the type of effect selected. For example, a weak poison at its base either causes the Poisoned condition for 1 round or 1d6 of poison damage. Choose one effect and raise the DC for the manufacture of the poison based on the total effect. The save against the poison itself is the base DC before any modifiers.
##### Poison Candle.
A candle that emits poisonous fumes for 1 hour when lit; The poison is airborne and affects everyone within a 30-foot radius. The candle must burn for 1d4 turns before the poison is released, so the assassin can light it and leave the room before it takes effect. In all other ways it is the same as a regular poison, above.
#### Protective Oil.
This alchemical oil protects against elemental damage by providing resistance to damage from one of the elements for the duration of a scene. The alchemist must choose which of the elements that the oil shields against: fire, cold, acid or lightning.
#### Purple Sap.
This elixir is made from a decoction of a purple Lily of the Valley, a flower whose cleansing properties and resistance to Corruption were discovered by the witches of Davokar long ago. Purchasing the elixir is expensive, because the ingredient is so rare and few alchemists are skilled enough to brew it. The elixir has no effect on permanent Corruption or on blight-­marks which have already appeared on the user.
- Weak: This potion removes 1 temporary Corruption from the soul.
- Moderate: The elixir immediately removes 1d4 temporary Corruption.
- Strong: This version removes 1d8 temporary Corruption.
#### Revealing Light.
A wax candle that when lit makes living creatures (not undead or abominations) glow softly in the dark, making it harder to stay hidden (disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks and advantage on Wisdom (Perception checks) for everyone. This affects everyone within a 30-foot radius, including the one who lit the candle.
#### Shadow Tint.
This horribly sickening elixir was once used by mystics wanting to hide just how close they were to becoming thoroughly corrupt, making it a welcomed addition to all sorcerers’ collections of mystical decoctions. Whoever manages to force down the sludge distorts their shadow for 24 hours, making it appear as if their Corruption total is 2d4 points lower.
#### Smoke Bomb.
The smoke bomb is a ceramic vessel that emits dense alchemical smoke when crushed, causing a sphere with a 15-foot radius to become highly obscured.
#### Spirit Friend.
The miraculous drug called Spirit Friend is cooked in a cauldron, but it is not the liquid that is bottled, but the vapors. The gray-­white smoke is captured in small ceramic jars and inhaled when needed. Spirit Friend shifts the user into the ethereal for 1d4 turns, to the price of as many points in temporary Corruption.
#### Spore Bomb.
The spore bomb can be thrown up to 30 feet and affects all creatures within a 10-foot radius, requiring them to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure the creature has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws for 1d4 + 1 rounds.
#### Stun Bolt.
The alchemist covers a crossbow bolt in a fast acting muscle relaxant; anyone hit by the bolt must pass a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become stunned and prone. The victim can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the stunned effect on a success.
#### Thorn Beasties.
A handful of seeds are thrown to the ground and one turn later 1d4 + 1 thorn beasties appear to serve the user. The thorn beasties are small, vaguely humanoid creatures made of thorns; they do not speak but squeak and crack as twigs that are bent and rubbed together. The beasties live for one hour before drying up to look like thorny witch dolls. The summoning of the thorn beasties is a clear violation of the natural order, meaning that the one using the seeds suffers 1d6 + 1 temporary Corruption.

|ACTIONS<br><br>Sharp Talons. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1 slashing damage.||||||

#### Thunder Ball.
An alchemical load that is thrown (range 30/90) at a target and detonates in a 5-foot radius with a sudden, loud flash, causing 1d12 thunder damage.
#### Transforming Draught.
This is a powerful mutagen which transforms the body of the user in a monstrous way. During a scene the user is twisted into a half-bestiaal creature and has disadvantage on all Charisma checks until the effect wears off.
The draught gives the user a monstrous trait for the rest of the scene; the level of the trait is decided by the strength of the elixir. In addition, each dose consumed deals temporary Corruption, also determined by the strength of the elixir. Of course, the physical transformation and the corrupting effect is reason enough for the elixir to be banned and only available on Ambria’s black market.
The following monstrous traits (see Bestial in the Bestiary) can be acquired, decided by the alchemist when brewing the elixir:
- Weak: The elixir gives either Aggressive or Awareness, at the cost of 1d4 temporary Corruption.
- Moderate: The elixir gives either Bite, Claws, or Leathery Skin, at the cost of 1d6 temporary Corruption.
- Strong: The elixir gives either Blood Frenzy, Enlarge, Reduce, or Wings, at the cost of 1d8 temporary Corruption.
#### Twilight Tincture.
This is an extract of dried stems and leaves from the extremely rare Twilight Thistle. Up until recently the rareness of the herb (on occasion, one or a couple of stems can be found among other offerings in the ruins of Davokar, rather than an actual growing site) coupled with its moderate medical effect made it not very sought-­after; it seems to have an effect on certain types of eczema and possibly also on senility if consumed.
However, with the aging of the queen mother has come an increased demand from the court. Of course, the tale of how Lasifor Nightpitch bought the land on which Thistle Hold is built for an armful of Twilight Thistles gave the herb a hefty boost in popularity among fortune hunters.
Lately, the twilight tincture has found another group of users, and a new area of use: it has proven capable of disguising a number of symptoms gained from being undead. Desperate unfortunates – some of them alchemists – searched for ways to hide their death marks, and someone discovered that the twilight tincture (consumed, not smeared on the skin) temporarily made an undead body come to life: the skin regained its redness, the body temperature rose, and the smell of the breath improved dramatically.
The effect lasts for a week and then the undead creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. If the save fails, the effect lingers for one more day before dissipating completely. On thoroughly corrupt creatures the effect only lasts for a day per dose, no saving throw is made.
#### War Paint.
Mystically charged paints can help a warrior in combat. War paint adds +1 to either your Strength modifier or Dexterity modifier for the next 10 minutes, and the warrior decides which attribute to boost when the paint is applied.
#### Waybread.
One loaf of this rich waybread corresponds to a week’s food supply for one person.
#### Wild Chew.
This is a strong stimulant, making the chewer more spirited, less careful and very aggressive. One dose of wild chew adds Reckless. The creature has advantage on its attacks and attackers have advantage on their attacks against the creature. The effect lasts one hour, after which the creature gains a level of exhaustion. Over time wild chew becomes very addictive and severe withdrawal symptoms will occur unless the user consumes at least one dose each week, with the risk of permanent madness or death. No known drugs can counteract this.
#### Wraith Dust.
Wraith dust forces an incorporeal being to take physical form for the next 10 minutes. The dust must be thrown (range 5/15) at a target. While corporeal the spirit takes damage as living creatures do (it loses any resistances or immunities during this time).

# Apothecary
Many herbs and plants can be found in the wilds. Each herb has a specific DC to find growing wild, through use of Survival or Apothecary. Some herbs only grow in specific environments, while others are pervasive and found in most areas of Ossura. Many common herbs are also available for sale by traders or in market places. Each herb also has a specific CR to brew into an oil or elixir. Both a failed and a successful Apothecary Skill Check to brew herbs consumes them.

### Augur’s Fire
Found: Distilled from Mercish Oil
To Brew: Alchemist Kit (DC22)
This thick, volatile, golden oil is extraordinarily dangerous to create and use. Even master alchemists will decline wealthy clients who seek to pay a fortune to have it made. Sometimes called alchemist’s gold, this oil burns with a white-amber heat. Only the Augurs have perfected the art of producing the oil, and the Tower of Eyes closely guards this secret.
A failed check to create the oil results in an explosion, inflicting a major wound on the brewer and all adjacent characters. On a roll of 1 on the d20 to brew the oil, this effect occurs twice. The oil is stored in clay spheres or other impermeable vessels. A character can light and throw such a vessel. If the Attack roll Critically Fails, it explodes in their hand, engulfing them and all adjacent characters in flame. If successfully thrown, it engulfs a small area in flame. Character that are engulfed in flame take one wound each round.

### Black Nightshade
Found: Pervasive - DC 17
Black Nightshade is a flower with a black bell. It grows in dark forests, caves, sewers, and other damp places with little light. It is used as a medicine and a poison. Its seeds are often brewed into beer as a way to increase its intoxicating effects. It impairs vision and causes deep dreamless sleep, but too much of it is poison.
Consuming the seeds or essence of Black Nightshade prompts a Constitution Save. If the dose is small, meant to induce sleep, the DC is 11 . A successful Check results in blurred and darkened vision. A failure results in deep sleep, lasting (10 - Con Modifier) hours.
If the dose is large, meant to kill, the Constitution Save is DC 16. If passed, the Character falls into a deep sleep and awakens with a Wound. If failed, they fall into a deep sleep and must make a Constitution Save (DC 16) each hour they are asleep or take a Wound. The drug induced slumber lasts (10 - Con Modifier) hours.

### Blue Lotus
Found: Banks of River - DC 10
To Brew: Alchemist Kit (DC 10)
Blue Lotus is grown along the banks of the Grey River and the foothills that are its wellspring. Referred to as sapphire-bliss, the Blue Lotus causes a state of relaxed inhibitions in which users are more talkative, comfortable, and aroused. Known to induce lassitude and blissful sleep, it is harvested seasonally and sold for recreational use in Mercos. It is especially popular among nobles and high-end pleasure houses. The most common method of consumption is to brew the flowers into a tea or steep them in alcohol for up to three weeks, as the alcohol enhances the effects of the active chemicals.
Those affected by Blue Lotus have Disadvantage to contest all Charisma Checks and Saves until they complete a Rest.

### Chokeweed
Found: Pervasive - DC 12
Chokeweed is a common grass used by hunters and trappers.
Eating the herb imposes Disadvantage on all Perception Checks made against you by beasts. This effect lasts until you complete a Rest.

### Corpsedust
Found: Pervasive - DC 16
To Brew: Alchemist Kit (DC 14)
An ash grey mold that grows best on land scorched by fire, Corpse Dust is used by thieves and assassins in powder packets to blind and disorient their foes.
Each packet creates a 5ft radius cloud of dust that hangs in the air for a round. The dust provides Total Concealment to characters inside or on the far side of the cloud.

### Copperbell
Found: Pervasive - DC 11
Small copper flowers that can be added to other concoctions as a catalyst.
Adding Copperbell reduces the brewing DC by 2 per Copperbell. Up to 3 flowers can be added to any one brew.

### Fever Bloom
Found: Mountains - DC 8
These bitter red berries are common in the north. When ingested, they accelerate one's metabolism, increasing body heat while draining energy.
Once eaten, these berries give Advantage to Saving throws against cold climate until a Rest.
They give Disadvantage to Saving throws against hunger and thirst.

### Iron Leaf
Found: Pervasive - DC 14
To Brew: Herbalist kit (DC 15)
Iron Leaf is a potent herb, often cultivated for its miraculous healing properties. Its leaves can be chewed raw or brewed as a potion for powerful effects. Though expensive, seldom is there a soldier or mercenary who does not carry an Iron Leaf potion.
When consumed as raw leaves, a Character heals 1 Wound. During their next Rest, they must make a Constitution Save (DC 10). If they pass, they Gain a level of Exhaustion. If they fail, they gain one Wound. A Character may only gain the restorative effects of Iron Leaf once until they undergo a Rest.
If brewed and distilled as a potion, it can be consumed to heal 1 Wound. During their next Rest, they must make a Constitution Save (DC 10). If they fail, they Gain a level of Exhaustion. A Character may only gain the restorative effects of an Iron Leaf potion once until they undergo a Rest.
Each time Iron Leaf is ingested in either form, the DC of the Constitution Save permanently increases by 1 for that Character.

### Moonwort
Found: Pervasive - DC 13
To Brew: Herbalist kit (DC 16)
A common, almost colorless flower, Moonwort delays the effects of poison. Moonwort can be used to stave off a poison until an antidote can be made — but it is also used for nefarious ends, giving ill-doers a window to poison others and escape before the deed becomes evident.
Eaten raw, it delays or postpones the onset of a poison by a few minutes (equal to Constitution modifier). If brewed as a potion, it can delay the effects by much longer (20 + Constitution modifier minutes). Subsequent doses continue to postpone the poison, but each inflicts a level of Exhaustion.

### Nightfoil
Found: Pervasive - DC 12
To Brew: Alchemist Kit (DC 10)
A common grey herb, used by healers to make antidotes.
Nightfoil can be eaten raw by a poisoned Character to grant them Advantage on their next Saving throw against it. When mixed with a small dose of poison it can be brewed in a potion that grants Advantage to all Saving throws to shake that poison.

### Red Death
Found: Dry Plains - DC 14
To Brew: Alchemist Kit (DC 20)
A rust-colored scrub grass from the Dry Plains, this herb can be decocted into a powerful elixir. Once boiled to its essence, it can be consumed to dramatically increase one’s heart rate to an unstable speed. Using such an elixir causes bleeding from the eyes, nose, and mouth, giving the herb its name.
A character who ingests such an elixir gains +6
Dexterity and +20 ft to their movement speed. These effects last until the Character rests. When the effects of the drug end, they receive a level of soft exhaustion for each round they exerted themselves, such as engaging in combat, and they receive a level of exhaustion for each time they have ever used the drug.

### Rimewood
Found: Pervasive - DC1 3
To Brew: Alchemist Kit (DC 15)
The bark of this tree can be ingested to treat fevers, relieving pain, and cooling the body, but it is prized for its other uses.
When distilled with other alchemical ingredients it becomes a powerful and addictive drug, referred to as Rime. It numbs the body and creates a state of euphoria while the heart slows and warmth drains from the body. It is highly addictive and its users are given away by their pale complexion, shivering , and chattering teeth. Many poor users of the drug die during cold winters and are found, covered in frost. Consequently, Rime is outlawed in most realms. Its illicit nature only makes its creation and smuggling profitable and dangerous trades. Despite this, its users are many, especially among the poor in great cities. In seedy quarters, one can find Rimehouses, dens for the thin, pale users to huddle around greasy fires, trying to rid themselves of the drugs deep chill.
A character who ingests Rime must succeed a Charisma Save (DC 8) or gain Disadvantage on all Checks until they rest. Each time Rime is taken, the DC of the Charisma Save permanently increases by 2 for that Character, to a maximum of 20.

### Serpent’s Fang
Found: Pervasive - DC 18
To Brew: Apothecary (DC 20)
A thorny plant that can be ground into a sinister poison. It is useless unless prepared as an oil.
A Character injured by a weapon poisoned with Serpent's Fang oil must make a  Constitution Save (DC 18) after each hour or take a Wound. The DC decreases by 2 each hour. Once passed, the poison stops. A Character cannot be affected by more than one dose of Serpent’s Fang at a time.

### Shadow Root
Found: Dry Plains - CR 15
The root of an amber desert flower. When chewed, it temporarily enhances the consumer’s night vision. They do not get Disadvantage due to darkness. It makes their eyes sensitive to bright light while affecting them and for a short time afterward. Consuming too much at once can cause temporary or lasting blindness. Frequent use of the herb leads to permanent catlike pupils and discomfort in bright light.
The effect lasts a few minutes for each root consumed. After the roots wear off, the Character must succeed on a Constitution Saving Throw (DC 8) or be sensitive to bright light for (8-Con Modifier) hours, receiving Disadvantage on all Skill Checks with a visual component. +1 CR for each additional root consumed.

### Spotcaps
Found: Pervasive - DC 13
To Brew: Apothecary (DC +2)
These small speckled mushrooms are edible and harmless on their own. When mixed with poisons however, they have a compounding effect.
Being poisoned by a toxin containing Spotcaps increases the DC of the poison by 1 for each Spotcap added to the mix, up to a maximum of 5. This increases the DC to brew the poison by 2 per Spotcap.

### Venomstar
Found: Pervasive - DC 20
To Brew: Alchemist Kit (DC 16)
The venom of this toxic plant can be made into a slick, coagulated oil. It is illegal to cultivate in most realms and few know how to find it in the wilds. Poisoning a weapon with brewed Venomstar oil makes the next Wound it inflicts more deadly. A Character Wounded by a Venomstar oil coated weapon must make a Constitution Saving Throw (DC 15). If they pass, they take a level of Exhaustion. If they fail, they take a Wound. This cannot affect a Character more than once per Rest, and the oil must be applied within an hour of use.
