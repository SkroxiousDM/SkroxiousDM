THE ARMOR TABLE shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor and shields used in the world of Symbaroum.

#### Armor Proficiency.

Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor’s use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can’t cast spells.

#### Armor Class (AC).

Implements the Challenge Mode AC rules, characters have an Evasion Class (EC) and an Armor Resistance (AR). In the base mode your EC is 10 + the dex mod applied to your AC (based on armor type used) + any shield AC you have.

Your AR is equal to your AC - applied dex mod, i.e. the part of your AC that is not nimbleness. This means that tanks, high armor class but weighed down take more glancing damage, but that damage is mitigated by your AR. The logic of the system is that part of hitting is having the blow land on the target, which is measured by the EC which rewards nimble characters and secondly damage reduction done when a glancing blow does not get "through the armor" and so the damage is reduced by the Armor Resistance.

For example, if an attack roll:

- Is less than your EC, then the attack misses
- Is greater than or equal to your EC and less than or equal to your AC, it is a hit, but it did not penetrate your armor, so the damage you take is reduced by your armor resistance.

1. The damage from an EC hit (i.e. greater than EC and <= AC) is scaled, so a tank with 8 points of armor reduction wil take 1/9. 2/9, ... 9/9 of the rolled damage when an EC hits for EC, EC +1, EC +2 ... EC+8

1. The damage reduction applies for all hits except critical hits.

- Is greater than your AC, then the attack hits normally.

Armor protects its wearer from attacks; an attack roll that is lower than your AC may still hit you but the armor prevents you from taking substantial damage. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class.

## Shields.

A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a buckler (a small shield) increases your Armor Class by 2, a regular shield increases your Armor Class by 3. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.

## Light Armor

Light armor is easy to come by and does not limit the wearer’s capabilities substantially in acrobatic situations or when performing stealthy maneuvers.

If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.

|Name|Cost|Armor Class|Wt.|Properties|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Blessed Robe|10 thaler|11 + Dexterity modifier|5 lb.|—|
|Concealed Armor|20 thaler|11 + Dexterity modifier|4 lb.|Concealable|
|Order Cloak|10 thaler|11 + Dexterity modifier|5 lb.|—|
|Skald’s Cuirass|30 thaler|12 + Dexterity modifier|20 lb.|—|
|Studded Leather|20 thaler|12 + Dexterity modifier|15 lb.|—|
|Witch Gown|10 thaler|11 + Dexterity modifier|5 lb.|—|
|Wolf Skin|1 thaler|12 + Dexterity modifier|15 lb.|Cumbersome|
|Woven Silk|50 thaler|12 + Dexterity modifier|6 lb.|—|

**Blessed Robe.** The priestly robes of the theurgs are blessed and protected by benevolent forces so that the Church’s finest can travel safely throughout the kingdom, and beyond.

**Concealed Armor.** Sorcerers have many reasons to stay hidden. To do this, they often weave mystically reinforced threads into their cloths, resulting in tunics and capes that look ordinary but offer protection. Other groups, such as spies, would love to have access to such garments, so they can avoid unwanted attention while still being ready for battle.

**Order Cloak.** Most novice mages of Ordo Magica are given a protective cloak in time for their first long journey. These cloaks are embroidered with warding runes, which increases the chance of the novice surviving to complete their appointed task.

**Skald’s Cuirass.** Rune singers are often warrior poets and many wear a flexible armor of woven cloth- or leather-­strips, strengthened with protective harmonies. The Skald’s Cuirass is durable without hampering the wearers’ movement, making it popular among other groups as well. For instance, wealthy duelists in Yndaros often color their cuirasses in personal colors, so that they can be recognized from afar.

**Studded Leather.** Also known as brigandine, this armor has metal plates riveted (the ‘studs’) to a leather overcoat and cloth inner lining.

**Witch Gown.** The witches of the clans bind protective spirits in carved pieces of bone and the skulls of fallen enemies, and attach them to their clothing for effective protection.

**Wolf Skin.** For poor barbarian scouts the cheap, cumbersome wolf skin armor is a common alternative; skin that has been tanned in the most simple way and sewn together into some kind of passable protection.

**Woven Silk.** Woven silk is the finest light armor available, since the close weave of its threads withstands stabs and cuts far better than its weight suggests. Woven silk has been used by both barbarians and Ambrians for a long time and some scholars speculate that the technique originally comes from the elves, possibly dating as far back as the days of the Iron Pact.

## Medium Armor

Medium armor offers better protection than the light versions but at the cost of being more restrictive to the wearer’s movements. However, this downside is considered an acceptable trade-­off by most melee combatants.

If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.

|Name|Cost|Armor Class|Wt.|Properties|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Chain Shirt|50 thaler|13 + Dexterity modifier (max 2)|20 lb.|—|
|Crow Armor|5 thaler|14 + Dexterity modifier (max 2)|30 lb.|Cumbersome|
|Double Chain Mail|125 thaler|14 + Dexterity modifier (max 2)|40 lb.|Noisy|
|Lacquered Silk Cuirass|60 thaler|14 + Dexterity modifier (max 2)|18 lb.|—|
|Laminar Armor|150 thaler|15 + Dexterity modifier (max 2)|40 lb.|—|
|Scale Mail|50 thaler|15 + Dexterity modifier (max 2)|45 lb.|Noisy|

**Chain Shirt.** A simple short-­sleeved shirt of chainmail that hangs down to mid-­thigh.

**Crow Armor.** Medium armor is more expensive than light, which is the reason why many warriors have picked, riveted and bound together a so-­called “crow armor” of their own. It is cheap, but far more difficult to move around in.

**Double Chain Mail.** Double-­threaded chainmail can only be crafted by the most skilled blacksmiths; with thinner rings that interlock in layers they craft an armor which is as flexible as chainmail but even more durable.

**Lacquered Silk Cuirass.** Barbarian warriors that have earned their place in the guard of a wealthy clan chieftain can sometimes be seen wearing a cuirass of lacquered silk, an armor that despite its apparent lightness protects like a breast plate. According to legend, the secret of lacquered silk was given to humankind by the elves, in a time when the Iron Pact was still strong and humans battled the parasitic darkness of Symbaroum.

**Laminar Armor.** This is an older armor-­type, nowadays often replaced by the cheaper scale mail or the flexible chainmail. However, some old laminar sets of armor are still around and there are blacksmiths who actually prefer them because of their greater protective capability. Some of Ambria’s noble houses still dress in this type of armor, for sentimental… or, as they claim, “traditional” reasons. laminar armor can only protect the torso, shoulders and hips – arms and legs are usually dressed in boiled leather (included in the Armor Class rating) to maintain mobility.

**Scale Mail.** This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish. The suit includes gauntlets.

## Heavy Armor

Those melee combatants that can afford it usually chose increased protection at the cost of even greater restrictions to their movement. A self-­respecting knight wears chainmail enforced by shoulder, knee and elbow plates, while those with the means tend to order themselves a personalized set of full plate armor.

Heavy armor doesn’t let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn’t penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.

|Name|Cost|Armor Class|Wt.|Properties|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Chain and Plate|250 thaler|15|50 lb.|—|
|Field Armor|500 thaler|17|70 lb.|Cumbersome, Weighty (13)|
|Field Armor of the Pansars|750 thaler|18|70 lb.|Noisy, Weighty (15)|
|Full Plate|500 thaler|16|65 lb.|Noisy, Weighty (15)|

**Chain and Plate.** A long-­sleeved, knee-­length set of chainmail with plates at sensitive joint areas like shoulders, elbows, knees, etc.

**Field Armor.** Field armor is a full plate forged with pleated sheets, making it less flexible than full plate, but even more impervious to slashing strikes and blows.

**Field Armor of the Pansars.** The master smiths working for the Pansars can forge full plate armor using pleated steel sheets while retaining the flexibility of standard plated armor.

**Full Plate.** Full plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body.
## Shields

The following rules on shields are still very simple compared to true old school, but they add enough texture to the world without becoming too complex. Below is a table with enough shields to give some variety to your players.

#### Shields

|Type|Cost|AC|DR|Strength|Stealth|Weight|Properties|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Buckler|5gp|+1||||3lbs|Special|
|Medium Shield|10gp|+2|1|12||5lbs||
|Large Shield|15gp|+2|2|14|Disadvantage|7lbs||
|Tower Shield|25gp|+2,<br>+4 ranged|3|15|Disadvantage|12lbs|Special|
|Mounted Shield|20gp|+2|1|12|Disadvantage|4lbs||

## Shield Properties

• Shields give a bonus to AC and they apply their AC bonus to dexterity and strength saving throws (because the user can hide behind them, use them for additional leverage, etc.  
• A grapple attack can grab a shield and pull it out of position. Success means the shield’s benefits are nullified until the owner escapes the grapple. The owner can move away without escaping, but they release the shield if they move out of reach of the character grappling it.  

**Damage Reduction:** Most shields grant a little damage reduction listed in the DR column.

**Buckler:** A buckler is a very small shield that can be affixed to the arm, freeing the combatant's hand for actions such as using a versatile weapon with two hands. Each round, the PC can choose whether to use the shield for defense, granting a +1 bonus to AC, or take an off hand attack action with that hand (or use an item), in which case there would be no AC benefit for that round.

**Tower Shield:** A tower shield can be used to provide cover. Either 1/2 or 3/4. If the player decides to use the tower shield in this way, they take either a -2 or -5 to their attack roll, respectively.

**Mounted Shield:** This is the only shield that can be used in conjunction with a lance while in mounted combat other than a buckler.

### Getting Into and Out of Armor

The time it takes to don or doff a type of armor or a shield is shown in the Donning and Doffing Armor table.

**Don.** This is the time it takes to put on the item. You benefit from its AC only if you take the full time to don it.

**Doff.** This is the time it takes to take off the item. If you have help removing armor, reduce this time by half.

#### Donning and Doffing Armor

|Category|Don|Doff|
|---|---|---|
|Light Armor|1 minute|1 minute|
|Medium Armor|5 minutes|5 minutes|
|Heavy Armor|10 minutes|10 minutes|
|Buckler|Object Interaction*|Gesture*|
|Shield|Action|Action|
|* Characters receive one free object interaction on their turn, which could be to draw and grip their buckler. Tossing the buckler to the ground is part of the character’s other free gestures and would not count as an action or object interaction.|||
