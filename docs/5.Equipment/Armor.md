# Avoidance Class (AC).

## Armor and Shields

The most common methods of protection, armor and shields, are things adventurers will commonly encounter. A character can only benefit from one set of armor and one shield at a time. The Armor and Shields table shows the most common options available, their price and weight, how they impact avoidance class and damage reduction, and any properties they possess.

## Armor

Armor is the most common way to minimize or mitigate damage from your enemies. The Armors table shows common armo shows the most common armors available, their price and weight, the base avoidance class they provide, and any properties they possess. Every armor is classified as light, medium, or heavy armor. The armor you wear determines your avoidance class, discussed later in this chapter.

- **Unarmored**. While unarmored, you add your full Dexterity modifier to your AC. Certain features, such as the Versatile Defense feature, allow you to add a second modifier to your AC while unarmored. 
- **Light Armor**. Light armor is the most flexible, offering unimpeded movement. While wearing light armor, you add your full Dexterity modifier to your AC. 
- **Medium Armor**. Medium armor offers a balance of protection and flexibility. While wearing medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to your AC.
- **Heavy Armor**. Heavy armor focuses on full protection from head to toe. Heavy armor doesn't let you add your Dexterity modifier to vour AC, but it also doesn't penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.

## Shields

Shields come in varying weights, sizes, and materials. The Armors table shows the most common shields available, their price and weight, the bonus to armor they provide, and any properties they possess. As with armor, shields are classified as light, medium, or heavy. 

- **Light Shields**. A light shield is generally affixed to the forearm. While a light shield does not fill the hand, you gain no benefit from it while the hand is full.
- **Medium Shields**. A medium shield is a common defensive technology that protects the user from weapons, the elements, or other hazar veapons, the elements, or other nazards.
- **Heavy Shlelds**. Heavy shields are much larger and more cumbersome, but they offer more protection than their smaller counterparts. Due to their cumbersome size, however, they can only be wielded alongside simple weapons.

## Barding and Plating

Armor is designed for creatures with humanoid anatomy, while barding and plating is designed for creatures with different anatomy, such as beasts and vehicles. For each armor, barding and plating exist at the same price and weight.

# Avoidance Class and Damage Reduction

Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor you wear-or lack thereof-determines two key capacities: your avoidance class and potential damage reduction.

## Avoidance Class

Avoidance class (AC) comes in four layers: base, armor, possible shield, and possible bonuses.
- **Base**. Your base AC is always 8+ your proficiency bonus.
- **Armor**. Your armor-or lack thereof-impacts your AC as well, and varies depending on the armor's type, as s discussed earlier in this section and illustrated in the Avoidance Class column of the Armor and Shields 
- **Shield**. If you equip a shield, you add that shield's bonus to your base AC as well as the AC-if any added by your armor, as illustrated in the Avoidance Class column of the Armor and Shields table.
- **Bonuses**. Certain features, such as the engineer's Infuse Item, offer a bonus to AC. These bonuses are in addition to those provided by your base, armor, and shield.

## Damage Reduction
Armor also offers passive armor damage reduction (DR) as illustrated in the Damage Reduction column of the Armor and Shields table. Armor DR only affects the damage you receive from attack rolls, as well as any damage you receive from weapons.

>**Overlapping Armors** Sometimes, you might have multiple features that would apply to your AC and DR. For instance, you Natural Armor special trait. In these circumstances, you choose which feature to benefit from.

## Armor and Shield Proficiency

While anyone can wear armor or wield a shield, only those who are proficient know how to properly use it Your class, traits, and feats sgrant grant you proficiency with certain armor types. If you wear armor or wield a shield in which you lack proficiency, you have disadvantage on any ability test that involves Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution, you can't cast, and you can't add your proficiency bonus to your AC.

If you have proficiency in armor, you have proficiency in the appropriate shield as well.

Armor protects its wearer from attacks; an attack roll that is lower than your AC may still hit you but the armor prevents you from taking substantial damage. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class.

## Armor Properties

Many armors and shields in the Armor table have properties related to their use. These properties are defined below.

### Bulky

While wearing armor with this property, you have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on sound

### Obtrusive

While wielding a shield with this property, you have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on sight.

### Strength

While wearing armor or wielding a shield with this property, your speed is reduced by 10 unless your Strength score meets or exceeds the strength number.

## Donning and Doffing Armor

The time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the armor's category. If you have help, you can reduce the time it takes to don or doff armor by half.

- **Don**. This is the time it takes to put on armor or wield your shield. You benefit from the armor only if you take the full time to don the suit of armor. 
- **Doff**. This is the time it takes to remove armor or store your shield.

###### DONNING AND DOFFING ARMOR

|Category 	|Don	|Doff|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Light armor	|1 minute	|1 minute|
|Medium armor	|5 minutes	|1 minute|
|Heavy armor	|10 minutes	|5 minutes|
|Shield (Light)|1 reaction on your turn|1 reaction on your turn|
|Shield (Medium)	|1 bonus action	|1 bonus action|
|Shield (Heavy)	|1 action	|1 action|

#### Variant: Casting Failure in Armor

In some realms, casting in armor might come at the consequence of fallure, regardless of armor proficiency. This variant rule, found in Appendix F, can help you introduce this concept in your campaigns
## Shields.

A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a buckler (a small shield) increases your Armor Class by 2, a regular shield increases your Armor Class by 3. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.

## Light Armor

Light armor is easy to come by and does not limit the wearer’s capabilities substantially in acrobatic situations or when performing stealthy maneuvers.

If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.

|Name|Cost|Armor Class|Wt.|Properties|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Blessed Robe|10 thaler|11 + Dexterity modifier|5 lb.|—|
|Concealed Armor|20 thaler|11 + Dexterity modifier|4 lb.|Concealable|
|Order Cloak|10 thaler|11 + Dexterity modifier|5 lb.|—|
|Skald’s Cuirass|30 thaler|12 + Dexterity modifier|20 lb.|—|
|Studded Leather|20 thaler|12 + Dexterity modifier|15 lb.|—|
|Witch Gown|10 thaler|11 + Dexterity modifier|5 lb.|—|
|Wolf Skin|1 thaler|12 + Dexterity modifier|15 lb.|Cumbersome|
|Woven Silk|50 thaler|12 + Dexterity modifier|6 lb.|—|

**Blessed Robe.** The priestly robes of the theurgs are blessed and protected by benevolent forces so that the Church’s finest can travel safely throughout the kingdom, and beyond.

**Concealed Armor.** Sorcerers have many reasons to stay hidden. To do this, they often weave mystically reinforced threads into their cloths, resulting in tunics and capes that look ordinary but offer protection. Other groups, such as spies, would love to have access to such garments, so they can avoid unwanted attention while still being ready for battle.

**Order Cloak.** Most novice mages of Ordo Magica are given a protective cloak in time for their first long journey. These cloaks are embroidered with warding runes, which increases the chance of the novice surviving to complete their appointed task.

**Skald’s Cuirass.** Rune singers are often warrior poets and many wear a flexible armor of woven cloth- or leather-­strips, strengthened with protective harmonies. The Skald’s Cuirass is durable without hampering the wearers’ movement, making it popular among other groups as well. For instance, wealthy duelists in Yndaros often color their cuirasses in personal colors, so that they can be recognized from afar.

**Studded Leather.** Also known as brigandine, this armor has metal plates riveted (the ‘studs’) to a leather overcoat and cloth inner lining.

**Witch Gown.** The witches of the clans bind protective spirits in carved pieces of bone and the skulls of fallen enemies, and attach them to their clothing for effective protection.

**Wolf Skin.** For poor barbarian scouts the cheap, cumbersome wolf skin armor is a common alternative; skin that has been tanned in the most simple way and sewn together into some kind of passable protection.

**Woven Silk.** Woven silk is the finest light armor available, since the close weave of its threads withstands stabs and cuts far better than its weight suggests. Woven silk has been used by both barbarians and Ambrians for a long time and some scholars speculate that the technique originally comes from the elves, possibly dating as far back as the days of the Iron Pact.

## Medium Armor

Medium armor offers better protection than the light versions but at the cost of being more restrictive to the wearer’s movements. However, this downside is considered an acceptable trade-­off by most melee combatants.

If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.

|Name|Cost|Armor Class|Wt.|Properties|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Chain Shirt|50 thaler|13 + Dexterity modifier (max 2)|20 lb.|—|
|Crow Armor|5 thaler|14 + Dexterity modifier (max 2)|30 lb.|Cumbersome|
|Double Chain Mail|125 thaler|14 + Dexterity modifier (max 2)|40 lb.|Noisy|
|Lacquered Silk Cuirass|60 thaler|14 + Dexterity modifier (max 2)|18 lb.|—|
|Laminar Armor|150 thaler|15 + Dexterity modifier (max 2)|40 lb.|—|
|Scale Mail|50 thaler|15 + Dexterity modifier (max 2)|45 lb.|Noisy|

**Chain Shirt.** A simple short-­sleeved shirt of chainmail that hangs down to mid-­thigh.

**Crow Armor.** Medium armor is more expensive than light, which is the reason why many warriors have picked, riveted and bound together a so-­called “crow armor” of their own. It is cheap, but far more difficult to move around in.

**Double Chain Mail.** Double-­threaded chainmail can only be crafted by the most skilled blacksmiths; with thinner rings that interlock in layers they craft an armor which is as flexible as chainmail but even more durable.

**Lacquered Silk Cuirass.** Barbarian warriors that have earned their place in the guard of a wealthy clan chieftain can sometimes be seen wearing a cuirass of lacquered silk, an armor that despite its apparent lightness protects like a breast plate. According to legend, the secret of lacquered silk was given to humankind by the elves, in a time when the Iron Pact was still strong and humans battled the parasitic darkness of Symbaroum.

**Laminar Armor.** This is an older armor-­type, nowadays often replaced by the cheaper scale mail or the flexible chainmail. However, some old laminar sets of armor are still around and there are blacksmiths who actually prefer them because of their greater protective capability. Some of Ambria’s noble houses still dress in this type of armor, for sentimental… or, as they claim, “traditional” reasons. laminar armor can only protect the torso, shoulders and hips – arms and legs are usually dressed in boiled leather (included in the Armor Class rating) to maintain mobility.

**Scale Mail.** This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish. The suit includes gauntlets.

## Heavy Armor

Those melee combatants that can afford it usually chose increased protection at the cost of even greater restrictions to their movement. A self-­respecting knight wears chainmail enforced by shoulder, knee and elbow plates, while those with the means tend to order themselves a personalized set of full plate armor.

Heavy armor doesn’t let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn’t penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.

|Name|Cost|Armor Class|Wt.|Properties|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Chain and Plate|250 thaler|15|50 lb.|—|
|Field Armor|500 thaler|17|70 lb.|Cumbersome, Weighty (13)|
|Field Armor of the Pansars|750 thaler|18|70 lb.|Noisy, Weighty (15)|
|Full Plate|500 thaler|16|65 lb.|Noisy, Weighty (15)|

**Chain and Plate.** A long-­sleeved, knee-­length set of chainmail with plates at sensitive joint areas like shoulders, elbows, knees, etc.

**Field Armor.** Field armor is a full plate forged with pleated sheets, making it less flexible than full plate, but even more impervious to slashing strikes and blows.

**Field Armor of the Pansars.** The master smiths working for the Pansars can forge full plate armor using pleated steel sheets while retaining the flexibility of standard plated armor.

**Full Plate.** Full plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body.
## Shields

The following rules on shields are still very simple compared to true old school, but they add enough texture to the world without becoming too complex. Below is a table with enough shields to give some variety to your players.

#### Shields

|Type|Cost|AC|DR|Strength|Stealth|Weight|Properties|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Buckler|5gp|+1||||3lbs|Special|
|Medium Shield|10gp|+2|1|12||5lbs||
|Large Shield|15gp|+2|2|14|Disadvantage|7lbs||
|Tower Shield|25gp|+2,<br>+4 ranged|3|15|Disadvantage|12lbs|Special|
|Mounted Shield|20gp|+2|1|12|Disadvantage|4lbs||

## Shield Properties

• Shields give a bonus to AC and they apply their AC bonus to dexterity and strength saving throws (because the user can hide behind them, use them for additional leverage, etc.  
• A grapple attack can grab a shield and pull it out of position. Success means the shield’s benefits are nullified until the owner escapes the grapple. The owner can move away without escaping, but they release the shield if they move out of reach of the character grappling it.  

**Damage Reduction:** Most shields grant a little damage reduction listed in the DR column.

**Buckler:** A buckler is a very small shield that can be affixed to the arm, freeing the combatant's hand for actions such as using a versatile weapon with two hands. Each round, the PC can choose whether to use the shield for defense, granting a +1 bonus to AC, or take an off hand attack action with that hand (or use an item), in which case there would be no AC benefit for that round.

**Tower Shield:** A tower shield can be used to provide cover. Either 1/2 or 3/4. If the player decides to use the tower shield in this way, they take either a -2 or -5 to their attack roll, respectively.

**Mounted Shield:** This is the only shield that can be used in conjunction with a lance while in mounted combat other than a buckler.

### Getting Into and Out of Armor

The time it takes to don or doff a type of armor or a shield is shown in the Donning and Doffing Armor table.

**Don.** This is the time it takes to put on the item. You benefit from its AC only if you take the full time to don it.

**Doff.** This is the time it takes to take off the item. If you have help removing armor, reduce this time by half.

#### Donning and Doffing Armor

|Category|Don|Doff|
|---|---|---|
|Light Armor|1 minute|1 minute|
|Medium Armor|5 minutes|5 minutes|
|Heavy Armor|10 minutes|10 minutes|
|Buckler|Object Interaction*|Gesture*|
|Shield|Action|Action|
|* Characters receive one free object interaction on their turn, which could be to draw and grip their buckler. Tossing the buckler to the ground is part of the character’s other free gestures and would not count as an action or object interaction.|||
