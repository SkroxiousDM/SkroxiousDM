WITH THE RENAISSANCE of artifact crafting, lesser artifacts have become available for purchase. These items are not necessarily more potent than alchemical elixirs, but are often of a more permanent kind. Each artifact requires attunement but does not add permanent Corruption.

Some lesser artifacts are tightly linked to a mystical tradition or a mystical power and of little use in more general terms, but many of them can be used by anyone and are sure to be a welcomed addition to the tools and equipment of any treasure hunter venturing into Davokar.

|* These artifacts do not need attunement||

Animal Mask.

Green path witches tend to identify with the beasts of the wild, a sentiment embodied by the wearing of animal masks. Every animal mask with mystical properties symbolizes an animal and gives the wearer advantage on one ability check for each long rest for the ability associated with that animal – Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma.

Bark Mask.

Green-­weaving witches often cover their faces with a mask of bark, as a symbol of their connection to nature. Many of these masks are infused with power and provide advantage on one ability check per long rest related to plants and anything growing.

Burial Shroud.

The spiritualists among the witches often wear a shroud over their head when contacting the spirits of the dead, since this makes the spirits calmer and allows for a deeper connection. A mystic using such an artifact gains advantage on one saving throw per long rest involving the spirits of the dead.

Death Mask.

The necromancers’ aspiration to dominate death has led to the use of hideous death masks that have been infused with power. A death mask gives advantage on one ability check per long rest for any check involving the intersections between life and death.

Healing Spider.

A small spider figurine which is placed on an open wound, where it quickly covers itself and the wound in a web that heals 1d12 hit points over the course of 8 hours. The spider cannot heal damage from poison or other internal injuries. If the Spider heals 1 or 12 hit points then the spider has reached the end of its power, otherwise the spider creeps up from the wound to be reused on new ones. The one treated by the healing spider suffers one point in temporary Corruption.

Iron Crown.

Demonologists often wear a crown of rusty iron when tearing at the world’s fabric. These crowns give advantage on a single saving throw per long rest if the saving throw involves demonic or otherworldly entities.

Lucky Coin.

A gold coin instilled with energies of good fortune. The coin is carried in a pocket and gives advantage to one ability check per short rest. Whoever toys with such energies is at risk of suffering from the opposite effect; if the result of the roll is a natural 20, the carrier will have disadvantage on every ability check until they can take a short (or longer) rest.

Marlit Cape.

The skin of a marlit, a reptile known for its sneaky hunting style, is treated with preserving alchemical preparations so that it keeps its camouflaging properties after the death of the beast. The wearer has advantage on one Dexterity (Stealth) check, and must take a long or extended rest before using this benefit of the cape again.

Meeting Stone.

A stone is loaded with an invitation to a specific person, who upon receiving and touching the artifact instinctively knows where the stone’s owner is waiting. Only a Mystic (or a character that can cast one or more spells) can activate a meeting stone.

Mind Prism.

The illusionists of Ordo Magica often use a prism to describe how the perception of reality may be broken down and understood. Some of these crystals are filled with so much suggestive energy that using the stone when casting an illusion improves it so much that when a viewer makes an ability check to detect the illusion it is at disadvantage. The caster must take a long or extended rest before using the stone again.

Mystical Focus.

A tradition-­specific focus allows the user to cast spells that normally require minor material components (i.e. a material component that does not give a cost and is not consumed with the casting).

Examples of Mystical Focuses

Witchcraft. Mask made of wood or bone, often painted or adorned with colorful beads.

Wizardry. Staff carved with power symbols.

Staff Magic. Staff head, often a stone entwined in filigree work or held by an ornamental claw.

Sorcery. Rod of human bone, engraved with dark runes.

Symbolism. A jar filled with air paint.

Theurgy. A holy symbol that glows softly in the dark and shines when used.

Rune Singing. A crumhorn, birchbark horn or similar instrument that hums or plays quietly even when not used.

Order Medallion.

The medallions of Ordo Magica are given to novices and stay with the wizards for their entire career. When the wizard reaches adept (2nd) level, the medallion transforms to symbolize this step; the same thing happens when reaching master (6th) level. Some chapters have made the order medallion mandatory and have also bound certain functions to it, such as the ability to open doors which are closed to outsiders/novices/adepts and to activate the chapter’s magic circle.

Plague Mask.

In a world full of contagions and poisons it is no wonder that many methods have been developed to resist such phenomena. The Confessors of the Sun Church, for instance, carry plague masks which allow the wearer to have advantage on saving throws to resist sicknesses and poisons. Once used, it must be recharged with a long or extended rest.

Ritual Codex.

A ritual is penned down in a codex so that another mystic can perform it without having previously learned the ritual. The codex can only be used once.

Ritual Focus.

A tradition-­specific object which reduces the time required for all rituals belonging to the tradition. The ritual requires only an additional 5 minutes instead of 10.

Examples of Ritual Focuses

Witchcraft. Clothing in natural fabrics with woven power symbols.

Wizardry. A collection of metal symbols, where different metals represent different elements or principles.

Staff Magic. A staff foot in metal, used to draw symbols on the ground.

Sorcery. Chalice shaped like the skull of a daemon, from which sacrificial blood is drunk during the ritual.

Symbolism. Rune- carving tools with glowing tips

Theurgy. Shrouding from a lightbringer, carried like a cape or draped over the object of the ritual.

Rune Singing. Stone tablet, wooden board or bone shield with carved symbols, functioning as a note or song sheet of ancient hymns and powerful rhythms.

Ritual Seal.

The artifact crafter binds a ritual to a seal; when broken, the effect of the ritual is triggered. The creator of the seal need not know the ritual, but must be in the company of one who does when it is created (or have access to a ritual codex explaining the ritual; the codex is destroyed with this act). He or she who breaks the seal suffers 1d4 temporary Corruption.

Ruler’s Ring.

Prominent mind-­warping wizards often carry a gold band on a finger, around the wrist or upper arm. To them, this represents the noble endeavor of the ruler. These rings are often instilled with the ability to dominate all living beings. If so, the gold ring gives the target of an enchantment spell disadvantage on its saving throw. This works only once per long or extended rest.

Rune Staff.

The hallmark of the staff mage is their personal staff, carved with the runes of the elements. In the hand of its owner, the staff is also the instrument through which the mage wields their powers.

Soul Stone.

A Soul Stone is the item required to perform the ritual with the same name.

Spark Stone.

The power of a pyromancer is increased by this glowing amber. The spark stone is a weaker version of the renowned sun stones that the master pyromancers of old could craft from summoned fire spirits. Nowadays, the fire wizards have to make do with lesser artifacts, not as powerful but still a great help to those whose skills relate to fire and burning. A pyromancer with a spark stone can reroll any fire damage dice that show a ‘1’ for a single spell. The stone must then be recharged with a long or extended rest.

Spell Seal.

An artifact crafter has bound a non-concentration spell at the novice (spell level) or adept (spell level plus 1) level to a seal; when the seal is broken, the power is activated. Whoever breaks the seal suffers temporary Corruption as if they cast the spell and the seal is spent when broken.

Spell Scroll.

Artifact crafters in Ordo Magica can bind a spell at the novice (the spell’s regular level), adept (the spell’s level plus 1) or master level (the spell’s level plus 2) to a scroll.

The power may then be activated by another character who can cast spells of the spell scroll’s base level. Whoever activates the scroll suffers temporary Corruption equal to the spell scroll’s base level. The scroll is spent upon activation.

Staff Foot.

A staff foot forged with strengthening spells can give the staff of a staff mage extra power when used as a weapon. The artifact is attached to the staff and gives the user advantage on one melee attack roll with the staff for each short or longer rest. Even if this artifact most often is attached to a rune staff, it may be attached to an ordinary wooden staff with the same effect.

Staff Head.

A special ornament at the top of the staff mage’s staff can provide extra focus. The staff head – often a beautiful stone encased in meteoric iron – gives advantage on one spell attack roll for each short or longer rest.

Sun Mask.

The sun masks of the theurgs bestow spiritual warmth to the cold-­hearted and spread light where no other light can reach. Worn by a theurg, it can also assist in combat against undead and abominations. The mask radiates light around the wearer as if it is a torch; in the light’s radius (60 ft.) the theurg can invoke its power to provide disadvantage on saving throws against banishing spells or turning undead once for each long rest.

Toad Guard.

A figurine in the form of a toad acts as an alarm. The user – who has to know at least one spell – whispers a triggering condition to the figurine; the trigger has to be of a physical nature and must occur close to the toad guard, for example that “someone passes through the grove” or “the door is opened from outside.” If activated, the toad will wake everyone with a loud croaking.

Transcendental Weapon.

These weapons were forged to allow a wielder to strike from a distance. Only mystics know how to use such an artifact. The attack is rolled as if in melee combat but may hit distant targets (up to 60 feet away) and requires the wielder to see the target.

Witch Braid.

This braid is made from three types of hair or fur and keeps death at bay, giving advantage to death saving throws.
