A tool helps you to do something you couldn’t otherwise do, such as craft or repair an item, forge a document, or pick a lock. Your origin, class, background, or feats give you proficiency with certain tools. Proficiency with a tool allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make using that tool. Tool use is not tied to a single ability, since proficiency with a tool represents broader knowledge of its use. For example, the GM might ask you to make a Dexterity check to carve a fine detail with your woodcarver’s tools, or a Strength check to make something out of particularly hard wood.

Musical Instrument

If you have proficiency with a given musical instrument, you can add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to play music with the instrument. Each type of musical instrument requires a separate proficiency.

- Bagpipe. A flute is attached to a leather bag which functions as a bellows. This instrument is particularly popular among some of the clans, but versions of it can also be found across the Ambrian countryside. However, it is never seen in Ambria’s finer salons…
- Brass Horn. A decent bellowing instrument for pompous situations.
- Birch-­bark Horn. Commoners in the Ambrian countryside use these horns for multiple purposes, but mainly to scare away beasts and call on their livestock. The horn is also used to send messages over long distances; a lone herdsman can signal surrounding holdings from where the message is passed on. Skilled horn-­blowers actually play in a unique way, so that everyone knows who is sending the message: “here be baiagorn tracks,” “a cow is missing” or “goblins have stolen my cheese.”
- Drum. A rhythm instrument that comes in many forms, from the simpler drums heard among the clans of Davokar, to the metal-­framed instruments of the Ambrian army.
- Fiddle. An often three-­stringed instrument, played with a bow made from horsehair, very common among peasants in Ambria.
- Flute. There are innumerable kinds of flutes, from slender metal flutes to wind instruments made from reeds, tree branches and horn. Other known types are the panpipe and the Shawm, the latter identified by its shrill tone.
- Hurdy-­gurdy. The hurdy-­gurdy is a string-­instrument with a crank handle that gives rise to a creaking sound to rhythmically accompany the music. It has long been popular in Ambria (and Alberetor before that), but in Yndaros it has come to be associated with beggars. Many refugees from the south earn their living by constantly exposing those passing by to a cacophony of melodic droning, creaking and grinding.
- Lute. String-­instrument with a pear-­shaped base, played with the fingers or a pick.
- Mouth Harp. The tiny mouth harp is carried by many daythalers, entertainers and jesters, and its sound can often be heard in the background at gatherings in Ambria’s simpler environments.
- Spinet. The spinet is a fingerboard instrument (a harpsichord) which is popular in the court of Yndaros and forms the backbone of Ambrian Court Music, together with the lute.

Navigator’s Tools

This set of instruments is used for navigation at sea. Proficiency with navigator’s tools lets you chart a ship’s course and follow navigational charts. In addition, these tools allow you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make to avoid getting lost at sea.

A poisoner’s kit includes the vials, chemicals, and other equipment necessary for the creation of poisons. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to craft or use poisons.

Thieves’ Tools

This set of tools includes a small file, a set of lock picks, a small mirror mounted on a metal handle, a set of narrow-­bladed scissors, and a pair of pliers. Proficiency with these tools lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to disarm traps or open locks.

Trapper’s Manual

A used copy of the famous ogre Crueljaw’s lustful tome, containing a lengthy and insightful record of traps, from simple mare snares and needle-­traps in box lids, to massive contraptions suited for a king’s burial mound. Learning from this book (see Training, ) allows you to detect and set traps.
