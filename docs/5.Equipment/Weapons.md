Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class’s focus and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you favor a longsword or a longbow, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring.

The tables show the setting’s most common weapons, their price, weight, damage, and any special properties. The weapons are classified as either melee or ranged. A melee weapon is used to attack a target within 5 feet of you, whereas a ranged weapon is used to attack a target at a distance.

After each table notes are given on any unusual weapons.

|Stafur (Quarterstaff)|2 shillings|1d6 bludgeoning|4 lb.|Half-swording, Versatile (1d8 + Reach)|

Barda Makir (Battle Mace) The barda makir is prevalent among the warriors of the Tenets of Nid. It’s like a stjorn maker, but instead of spikes, the battle mace has sharp flanges.

Hring Seax (Ring Knife) The hring seax or ring knife is perhaps most common in Mittland. Its single-edged blade is usually slightly inward curving, and there is a ring at the end of the handle, sometimes used to tie the weapon to the wielder’s wrist. The shape of the hring seax in Mittland bears strong influences from Elven weapons. In Mittland, the hring seax shows that the wielder is faithful to the Eald Tradition. A hring seax is seldom used for household activities, it is instead a weapon mainly conceived for combat.

Klubb (Club) A klubb is one of the most common weapons among those who cannot support themselves as warriors. The klubb is cheap and easy to fight with. Primitive klubbs consist of a truncated tree branch.

Lill Spjót (Short Spear) The lill spjót is cheap and easy to use for an inexperienced warrior. It can also be used for hunting if the hunter is brave enough to stand close to his prey

Nagli Klubb (Spiked Club) A more developed variant of the klubb is the nagli klubb. Often made from wood, this club has spikes at the top to inflict more damage.

Seax (Dagger or Knife) The seax is both a weapon and a tool that’s carried by most of Trudvang’s inhabitants. Seax exist in many varieties adapted for throwing, thrusting, and cutting. Some are made for hunting, fishing, and household use: these blades are usually single-edged knives. Other varieties are doubleedged daggers with sharp points, fit for piercing attacks. In the Stormlands, the Bjorn paw or bear paw is a favored weapon, and the short, broad-bladed seax carries much symbolism for Gerbanis. A knife is used for ritual Blood Gifting, and many warriors wear one on their belts as a last resort when all other weapons are lost or too heavy to lift.

Split Axi (Hand Axe) Like the seax, the split axi is partly carried as a utility tool, and partly as a weapon if need be.

Stafur (Staff) The stafur works both as a walking stick and as a weapon. Staves made for fighting need to be metal reinforced and balanced.

Simple Ranged Weapons

|Spear Sling|5 thaler|1d6 piercing|2 lb.|Ammunition (range 40/160), deep impact|

Veidi Bogi (Hunting Bow). Shorter than a longbow, this weapon can be used while mounted and also works well on foot within the forest of Davokar.

Spear Sling. The barbarians of eastern Davokar, and especially the members of clan Karohar, prefer the use of spear slings – a throwing arm with a hook that is attached to the end of a short spear in order to throw it with tremendous force. It can also be used as a club in melee

Assassin’s Blade. The slender grip and the feather-­thin steel of the blade makes this weapon easy to conceal without sacrificing its bite. It is easily strapped to the wrist or ankle, or even attached behind the neck with a lump of resin. Special girdles or hidden pockets in clothes work just as well. The weapon can be smuggled past guards, to be used on secret missions or to be handed over to a prisoner.

Axe. Preferred weapon of many barbarians.

Bastjur Kedjá (Troll Chain) A Bastjur kedjá is a bigger version of the barda klót that can also be thrown. Some balls have studs or long spikes. Fighting with this weapon is tough and requires much skill, but its force is good against shields and in spaces where the ball has the potential to hit with full power.

Chain Staff. The chain staff was developed by elves and has been adopted by some barbarian clans. The weapon is composed of a staff with a short chain attached to each end, making it possible to use the weapon to ensnare a target. The chains often end in a weight or a short blade, making it even more deadly.

Crow’s Beak. A less elegant, but still effective weapon is the crow’s beak, also known as a Kandorian war pick after the city in Alberetor where it was first forged. The crow’s beak is a club whose metal head is fitted with a spike or a beak of steel, in order to punch through armor more easily. After the escape to Yndaros, the smiths of the Kandorian war pick settled down in the district of Old Kadizar where they have continued to craft their dreaded weapons.

Double-­axe. The barbarian double-­axe (not to be confused with the more common pole axe with its single-­edged axe head) is aptly named after its twin axe heads and is presumed to be a legacy from the fallen Symbaroum. In those days the double-­axe was a weapon as well as a symbol of status and standing. Even though the knowledge of metallurgy has dwindled since the fall of Symbaroum these powerful weapons can still be forged, often made for particularly prominent warriors. Ambrians consider the double-­axe crude and savage, fit for barbarians and few else, but its shape is well known because of its similarity to the royal rune, Labrys.

Estoc. This is a fencing sword but with a tapered blade that ends in a wedge-­shaped tip, intended to penetrate the target’s armor.

Fencing Sword. In Yndaros, the Ambrian fencing sword is considered to be of the highest fashion, an instrument with superior precision made from strong but flexible steel. It is often combined with the duelist’s favorite, the parrying dagger, which gives the lightly armored fighter a stronger defense in combat.

Barda Faldir (Battle Flail) The barda faldir is predominantly used by the warriors of the Tenets of Nid. It’s a combat version of the flails that are used for farming. The barda faldir often has a wooden shaft, a chain, and an oblong head with spikes.

Villtur Axi (Bearded Axe) The blade of this axe is L-shaped in order to widen the cutting surface without augmenting the weight. The villtur axi is the battle axe that the Stormlanders prefer, notably the rangers. It is also used sparingly by the Viranns, but not that often by the Mittlanders, who think it to be too unwieldy. With its long shaft, the villtur axi is sometimes longer than the barda axi but smaller than the tvei axi. A strong and big wielder may be able to learn to use it with one hand.

Tvei Faldir (Two-Handed Flail) The tvei feldir resembles the regular barda faldir except that it has a significantly longer shaft and striking head.

Tvei swerd (Greatsword). This double-­handed blade is the weapon of choice for some of the most famous knights of Ambria.

Breid Spjót (Broad-bladed Spear). The breid spjót, or hoggvaspear (hewing spear) or pole blade, as it also is called, is most common in Mittland. It consists of a long wooden shaft and a tip that resembles a seax, or even a short sword. There are variants with a curved edge, but those are most common among the Arks. The length varies between that of a lill spjót and a spjót but is seldom longer than 7 feet. The main advantage of this weapon is long reach combined with the possibility of making not just piercing but also slashing and chopping attacks

Lance. The value of this weapon should not be underestimated – the largest monstrosities of the Dark Lords were often slain by lances in the hands of brave knights. The weapon was also used by the Ambrian cavalry to gain dominance over the lowlands and drive barbarians, packs of predators and abominations into the forest of Davokar.

Barda Hammri (Battle Hammer) The barda hammri is developed from a regular blacksmith hammer, though it sometimes can be hard to tell them apart. The barda hammri often has a wooden handle and a big iron head. Some barda hammris have studs or nails on one side of the head

Stakk Swerd (Long Sword) The stakk swerd has a long, double-edged blade. Often the blade is narrow and relatively thin, making it a weapon capable of being used in one hand.  It’s a good weapon for protection, and the small tip is good for working into cracks in the enemy’s armor. Using the crossguard as an improvised battle hammer is common. The master smiths of the Pansars forge the finest weapons in Ambria, and the swords of the Queen’s Guard are an exquisite testament to that fact, at least when wielded by the right warrior. The weapon is preferably handled with both hands but can also be used single-­handedly with a shield.

Maul. This weapon is a long-­handled hammer with a heavy head of wood, lead, or iron.

Parrying Dagger. The parrying dagger, with its wide and v-­shaped cross-­guard, has become very popular in Yndaros, and is often wielded together with a fencing sword.

Pike. The slender shaft and fire-­tempered steel point of the Ambrian pike slides towards the target with great precision.

Glaaf (Short Sword) A glaaf is slightly longer than the hring seax and usually has two edges. The skalm is a variant with only one sharp edge. The glaaf is most common in the eastern parts of Trudvang and it was the weapon of choice of the ancient Broths.

Stiletto. The slender and agile stiletto is a dagger whose razor sharp point stabs deeply – the weapon of an assassin.

Whip. This whip has been adapted from the common herding or slave-­driving whip; its function is not only to drive but also to snare the target. Also, its length gives it a considerable flicking power able to wound lightly armored targets.

|Throwing Wing|10 thaler|1d6 bludgeoning|1 lb.|Returning, thrown (range 30/90)|

Arbalest. This is a heavy Ambrian crossbow with a bow of feather-­light steel, which gives its bolts a bit of extra punch.

Blowpipe. The purpose of this weapon is to fire a poisoned dart towards a target. The dart deals minimal damage itself, but penetrates any protection worn on a successful hit. See for more details on poisons.

Bolas. This weapon is used in Davokar when someone wants to capture the prey alive; or in order to slow down a target before moving in for the kill. The bolas are made of two or more weights tied together with ropes that, together, are hurled at the target’s legs or arms in order to hinder movement. Normally, such a weapon is thrown at the opponent’s legs and if the attack roll is successful, the target becomes prone and restrained. It is harder to hit the arms of the target – this requires an attack roll at regular range with disadvantage. On a success the target cannot use their arms. Removing the bolas requires an action to attempt a DC 13 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.

Composite Bow. Among the wagon-­riding Varaks and Saars who live on the plains west of Davokar, bow-­making is a highly esteemed art form. The composite bow is made from layers of horn and sinews over a wooden core; it is shorter and not as precise as the longbow but more powerful. Its size makes it perfect for use while on horseback, the driver’s seat of a wagon or the narrow platform of a battle chariot.

Crossbow, hand. Among the thieves and gangs of Yndaros, a smaller and more easily concealed version of the crossbow is used. It can be held and fired in one hand, but requires two to load and has nearly the same punch as the standard crossbow. Assassins often apply poison to the bolts, making the weapon very effective for its size.

Crossbow, repeating. This is a mechanically advanced version of the crossbow. The weapon has a push lever underneath, for quicker reloading. Only the most skilled blacksmiths are able to construct such technically advanced weaponry.

Throwing Wing. These weapons are designed to return to the user if they miss their target. In the depths of Davokar, throwing wings made from hardened wood are used to hunt small game, while the ones used in combat have a knife-­sharp edge of steel all around the wing.A proficient user can catch a returning wing as an object interaction.

Untrained Use of Alchemical Weapons

The alchemical weapons which may be used by anyone entail risk for the untrained - they must roll a d20, on a natural 1 the weapon blows up in their face. If this happens the user takes damage automatically. Any creatures within the area effect of the device must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking full damage on a failed save and half damage on a successful one. Trained users do not risk such catastrophic failures.

Breaching Pot. This is a jar filled with volatile substances that explode when ignited or crushed. If the breaching pot has been buried close to a structure it has the siege quality; if it detonates in open air, it has an area effect instead. Note that whoever sets up a breaching pot must use a fuse to avoid suffering from the effect. Anyone can use a breaching pot but only those proficient with Alchemical Weapons can do so without risking a catastrophic failure. See the sidebar. Breaching pots can also be used as ammunition for catapults, in which case they have an area effect on impact.

Using an Alchemical Firetube

Firetubes have an area of effect. Instead of making an attack roll, creatures in the area of effect must make a Dexterity saving throw against a DC equal to 8 plus your proficiency bonus plus your Dexterity modifier. Creatures that succeed on the saving throw take half damage, those that fail take normal damage and are subject to any conditions until the end of their next turn.

Firetube, portable. This is a lighter version of the stationary siege weapon with the same name.

The portable version is made of a solid pipe, which is loaded with alchemical flammables that when ignited turn the weapon into a flamethrower. Anyone can use this weapon but see the sidebar about untrained use.

Firetube, stationary. This weapon consists of a cylinder – usually a hollowed log, but fully cast versions also exist – which is loaded with alchemical flammables that when ignited turn the weapon into a devastating flamethrower. This device requires proficiency with alchemical weapons to use.

Throwing Grenades

When you throw a grenade, you can either aim for a creature, in which case the to-hit roll is against its AC, or aim for a specific spot on the ground which is AC 13. On a failure the grenade lands somewhere else: roll 1D8 for cardinal direction (1 = north, 2 = north-east, 3 = east, etc.) and 1d10 for distance in feet and explodes.

Grenade. The alchemical grenade is the smaller cousin of the breaching pot – a sturdy ceramic vessel is filled with volatile substances that explode when ignited with a fuse or when the vessel is crushed. The grenade is fist-­sized and is thrown by hand or with a sling. Anyone can use this weapon but see the sidebar about untrained use.

Firetube Ammunition

|* A breaching pot can be used as ammunition instead of a rock, in this case the breaching pot explodes as if it were on the ground and uses those statistics and properties instead.|||||

Ballista. Essentially, this is a massive, stationary crossbow, intended to fire at fixed targets, troop formations on the field and monsters of the most robust sort. In The Great War, the ballista was used against the undead draft beasts of the Dark Lords, with the intent of stopping their siege towers from reaching the ramparts. This continued during the colonization of Ambria, with the tame beasts of the barbarian warlords as the primary targets. Even today, ballistae are aimed towards Davokar from atop outposts and wall-­towers.

Catapult. Ballistic devices have long been employed in Alberetor’s many wars, and most frequently used, then and now, is the catapult. Compared to its bigger cousin, the trebuchet, it is relatively easy to transport but still very effective against both structures and troops. It takes someone proficient with siege weapons to load, aim and fire a catapult; it can be loaded with boulders or with breaching pots, the former crushing buildings and the latter more effective against weaker but flammable targets, including hostile troop formations on the field of battle.

Missile Battery. The missile battery is a siege weapon unsuitable for use by anyone but trained Sappers. It consists of a wooden frame into which dozens of missiles can be loaded. When ignited, the burning, screeching missiles rain down on the enemy troops.

Trebuchet. The queen of siege weapons is the mighty trebuchet, a ballistic device with power enough to raze the sturdiest walls, at least after a number of shots. The trebuchet can only be handled by someone proficient with siege weapons.

WEAPON PROPERTIES

Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapon tables.

Ammunition. You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you also have an appropriate type of ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-­handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.

If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see “Improvised Weapons” later in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Area Effect. This weapon’s ammunition explodes. Instead of making an attack roll, the user designates an area and each creature in the area makes a Dexterity saving throw with the DC equal to 8 + the user’s proficiency bonus plus their attack modifier. A failed save means the target takes full damage and a successful save means that they take no damage.

Balanced. The weapon is so well balanced that it is extra effective when parrying. If you wield this weapon in one hand with a weapon in the other hand increase your AC by 1.

Crewed. These weapons requires several individuals to operate them successfully. The minimum crew is given in parentheses and at least one member must be proficient with siege weapons.

Concealed. This blade can be hidden on a creature’s body, underneath clothes or armor. Make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check when you hide it, and compare against passive Perception or an active search as needed.

Deep Impact. This weapon is built such that a precise blow can cause extraordinary damage. If you score a critical hit with this weapon you double both the damage dice and the damage modifier.

Ensnaring. This weapon can wrap around limbs, temporarily pulling an enemy off balance. When you make a critical hit with one of these weapons, if the target is a creature it is knocked prone in addition to taking normal damage.

Finesse. When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Grappling. This weapon can be used to initiate a grapple.

Half-Swording. Two-handed. Reduce the sword’s damage die to 1d4. Lose Reach property. Gain +2 to attack vs. armor, +2 to grapple, +1 to AC.

Heavy. Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon’s size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Immobile. Setting up this weapon or breaking it down can only be done outside of combat (several hours usually).

Light. A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Loading. Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Long-reach. Long Reach weapons have reach of 15′, but they have disadvantage on attack rolls if an obstacle (walls, trees, etc.) or enemy is within 5 feet of the wielder.

Massive. Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with massive weapons. A massive weapon’s size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively. When rolling damage for a massive weapon, roll the damage die twice and take the better result. This applies only to the initial damage die, not any bonus damage.

Range. A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition, ranged or thrown property. The range usually lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon’s long range. If it lists only 0, then the weapon fires directly, usually in a line or cone shape. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll, or defenders have advantage on their saving throw. You can’t attack a target beyond the weapon’s long range.

Reach. This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it (see chapter 9).

Reload. This weapon requires the crew to take the Reload action after firing it and thus can only be shot every other round.

Restraining. A successful hit with this weapon causes the restrained condition.

Returning. If you miss with this weapon it returns to your hand.

Siege. This weapon does double damage to structures.

Special. A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon’s description (see “Special Weapons” later in this section).

Thrown. If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.

Two-­Handed. This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

Versatile. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property – the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

Armor-Piercing

+3 attack vs. targets in medium or heavy armor and monsters with equivalent defenses. (It’s up to the DM if a monster qualifies, but generally monsters with AC 16 or higher due to tough hides or armor plates would fit.)

The armor-piercing weapon property is added to these weapons:

- Morning star
- Pick
- Estoc
- Longbow with bodkin head (armor-piercing) arrows (1d6 damage)
- Heavy crossbow
- Firearms

Armor-Crushing Weapons

If the attack misses by 5 or less, deal bludgeoning damage equal to strength bonus, minimum 1 damage.

The armor crushing weapon property is added to these weapons:

- Warhammer
- Greataxe
- Mace
- Greatclub
- Maul

That leaves swords out of the armor-piercing fun, but there was a tactic used to make them more useful against armor called half-swording. The wielder gripped the blade with their off-hand to use the sword as more of a precision and powerful thrusting weapon that could also be used better for grappling and defense. So swords can be used with this new attack stance:

Half-Swording: 

Two-handed. Reduce the sword’s damage die to 1d4. Gain +2 to attack vs. armor, +2 to grapple, +1 to AC.

Sometimes characters don’t have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, or a wagon wheel.

Often, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the DM’s discretion, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use their proficiency bonus.

An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the DM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

SILVERED WEAPONS

Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 50 thaler. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective.

SPECIAL WEAPONS

Weapons with special rules are described here.

Lance. You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren’t mounted.

Net. A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.

When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.
