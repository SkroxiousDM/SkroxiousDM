BLACK BOLT*
1st-­level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 ft.
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You summon some measure of the darkness that plagues your soul and send it outwards as a bolt of blackness at a creature within range. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by the magic as it envelops them like shadowy tentacles. At the end of its turn, the creature can attempt a Strength saving throw to break free. If the creature’s size is larger than the caster’s it has advantage on the saving throw.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each level above 1st.
