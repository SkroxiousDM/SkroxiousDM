HOLY SMOKE

1st-­level divination (ritual only)

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 10 feet

Components: V,M (incense)

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You light incense and choose a 10-foot cube within range. The smoke spreads among those present and gathers around objects and creatures in relation to how corrupted they are: the closer the smoke gathers, the more tainted the creature in question is. The Game­master clearly states if objects or creatures are blight-­stricken, blightmarked or thoroughly corrupt. (See {[[Corruption & Shadow]]}).

Holy smoke can be countered by the exchange shadow spell.
