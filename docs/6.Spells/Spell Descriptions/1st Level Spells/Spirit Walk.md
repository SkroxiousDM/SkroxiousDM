SPIRIT WALK

1st-Â­level transmutation (ritual)

Casting Time: 1 minute

Range: Self

Components: V

Duration: 10 minutes

You project your spirit body into the border regions of the Ethereal Plane, in the area where it overlaps with your current plane. The material body you leave behind is unconscious. Your spirit body resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating your game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way home. If the cord is cut--something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it does--your soul and body are separated, killing you instantly. 

You remain in the Border Ethereal for the duration or until you use your action to dismiss the spell. During this time, you can move in any direction. If you move up or down, every foot of movement costs an extra foot. You can see and hear the plane you originated from, but everything there looks gray, and you can't see anything more than 60 feet away. While on the Ethereal Plane, you can only affect and be affected by other creatures on that plane. Creatures that aren't on the Ethereal Plane can't perceive you and can't interact with you, unless a special ability or magic has given them the ability to do so. You ignore all objects and effects that aren't on the Ethereal Plane, allowing you to move through objects you perceive on the plane you originated from.

The spell ends for you when you use your action to dismiss it. The spell might also end early. A successful dispel magic spell used against your spirit form or material body ends the spell. If your material body or your spirit form drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. If the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the your spirit form back to your material body, and you awaken.
