# 1st Level Spells

## Animal Friendship | Befriend Beast
1st-level enchantment (ritual)<br/>
Casting Time: 1 action<br/>
Range: 30 feet<br/>
Components: V, S, M (a biscuit baked out of meat and grain)<br/>
Duration: 1 hour<br/>
Replaces: Animal Friendship & Animal Messenger<br/>

You magically persuade a beast that you are a trusted ally. Choose a beast that you can see within range, which must be able to see and hear you. The beast must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the spell's duration. Beasts with Intelligence 4 or higher automatically succeed on this save. If you or one of your companions harms the target, the spell ends.

The beast is willing to perform simple tasks on your behalf, including scouting locations, finding things, or delivering objects. If asked to deliver a message, it can understand locations and a general description of a target, though it cannot reliably find an individual. A beast delivering a message typically covers 1 mile per hour walking, or 2 miles per hour if it can fly.

At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level, the duration of the spell increases to 24 hours. If you use a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can either increase the duration by another 24 hours for each slot level above 2nd or affect one additional beast for each slot level above 2nd.

1st-­level evocation (No Favour)<br/>
Casting Time: 1 action <br/>
Range: 120 ft. <br/>
Components: V, S <br/>
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute<br/>

You summon some measure of the darkness that plagues your soul and send it outwards as a bolt of blackness at a creature within range. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by the magic as it envelops them like shadowy tentacles. At the end of its turn, the creature can attempt a Strength saving throw to break free. If the creature’s size is larger than the caster’s it has advantage on the saving throw.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each level above 1st.

Flames shoot forth from your fingertips. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
The flames ignite any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 and the range of the cone increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 1st.

1st-level divination (ritual only)<br/>
Casting Time: 1 action<br/>
Range: 10 feet<br/>
Components: V,M (incense)<br/>
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute<br/>

You light incense and choose a 10-foot cube within range.
The smoke spreads among those present and gathers around
objects and creatures in relation to how corrupted they are:
the closer the smoke gathers, the more tainted the creature
in question is. The Gamemaster clearly states if objects or
creatures are blight-stricken, blightmarked or thoroughly
corrupt. (See Corruption, page 38).

Holy smoke can be countered by the exchange shadow spell.

## Illusory Script | Secret Missive
1st-level illusion (ritual)<br/>
Classes: Bard, Warlock, Wizard<br/>
Casting Time: 1 minute<br/>
Range: Touch<br/>
Components: S, M (magical ink worth at least 10 gp, which
the spell consumes)<br/>
Duration: Special<br/>
Replaces: Illusory Script<br/>

You pen a secret message on a parchment, paper, or other
writing material. When you write the message, choose a
password or passphrase; when a creature speaks this code
while holding the parchment, the secret message appears for
10 minutes before fading again. Alternatively, you can specify
a creature. The message automatically appears when it holds
the parchment. You can write any other text on the
parchment, which becomes invisible anytime the secret
message is displayed. When the spell ends, the secret
message disappears forever.

Creatures with truesight can see the secret message. A
dispel magic cast on the parchment ends the spell without
revealing the secret message.

The spell's duration is related to the quality of ink used.
Magical ink worth 10gp gives it a duration of 10 days. More
expensive ink lasts an additional day for each 1gp spent; if
100gp worth of magical ink is used, the duration becomes
permanent.

## Inflict Wounds

## Longstrider


## Mage Armor


## Magic Missile

##	Shield	| Deflect
1st-level abjuration<br/>
Classes: Sorcerer, Wizard<br/>
Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when you are hit
by an attack or targeted by the magic missile spell<br/>
Range: Self<br/>
Components: V, S<br/>
Duration: 1 round<br/>
Replaces: Shield<br/>

A transparent sphere of arcane force appears, averting
incoming attacks. Until the start of your next turn, you have a
+5 bonus to AC, to a maximum of 21 AC, including against
the triggering attack, and you take no damage from magic
missile.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 3rd level or higher, the bonus to AC (and the maximum
AC) increases by 1 for every two slot levels above 1st (for
example, when cast with a 5th level spell slot, you have a +7
bonus to AC, to a maximum of 23 AC).

## Sleep

##	Speak With Animals/Plants	| Speak with Nature
1st-level divination (ritual)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (30-foot radius)
Components: V, S
Duration: 10 minutes
Replaces: Speak with Animals and Speak with Plants

You can verbally communicate with natural organisms for the
duration. This allows beasts to answer questions you pose; at
minimum, beasts can inform you about whatever it can
perceive or has perceived within the past day, including
nearby locations and monsters.

The knowledge, awareness, and personality of a beast is
limited by its intelligence, but you may deceive, intimidate,
persuade, or otherwise influence a beast at the DM's
discretion. An organism is under no compulsion to answer
(or answer truthfully) if you are hostile to it, or it recognizes
you as an enemy.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 2nd level or higher, you imbue plants with limited
sentience, allowing you to communicate with them like
beasts. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level
or higher, you imbue plants with limited animation, allowing
them to freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks. You can
command plants to release a restrained creature, to turn
ordinary terrain into difficult terrain (or the opposite), or to
perform other tasks at the DM's discretion.

## Spirit Walk
1st-­level transmutation (ritual)<br/>
Casting Time: 1 minute<br/>
Range: Self<br/>
Components: V<br/>
Duration: 10 minutes

You project your spirit body into the border regions of the Ethereal Plane, in the area where it overlaps with your current plane. The material body you leave behind is unconscious. Your spirit body resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating your game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way home. If the cord is cut--something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it does--your soul and body are separated, killing you instantly.

You remain in the Border Ethereal for the duration or until you use your action to dismiss the spell. During this time, you can move in any direction. If you move up or down, every foot of movement costs an extra foot. You can see and hear the plane you originated from, but everything there looks gray, and you can't see anything more than 60 feet away. While on the Ethereal Plane, you can only affect and be affected by other creatures on that plane. Creatures that aren't on the Ethereal Plane can't perceive you and can't interact with you, unless a special ability or magic has given them the ability to do so. You ignore all objects and effects that aren't on the Ethereal Plane, allowing you to move through objects you perceive on the plane you originated from.

The spell ends for you when you use your action to dismiss it. The spell might also end early. A successful dispel magic spell used against your spirit form or material body ends the spell. If your material body or your spirit form drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. If the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the your spirit form back to your material body, and you awaken.

## Thunderwave
