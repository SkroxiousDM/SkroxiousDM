# 1st Level Spells

## ANIMAL Friendship | Befriend Beast
1st-level enchantment (ritual)

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 30 feet

Components: V, S, M (a biscuit baked out of meat and grain)

Duration: 1 hour

Replaces: Animal Friendship & Animal Messenger

You magically persuade a beast that you are a trusted ally.

Choose a beast that you can see within range, which must be able to see and hear you. The beast must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the spell's duration. Beasts with Intelligence 4 or higher automatically succeed on this save. If you or one of your companions harms the target, the spell ends.

The beast is willing to perform simple tasks on your behalf, including scouting locations, finding things, or delivering objects. If asked to deliver a message, it can understand locations and a general description of a target, though it cannot reliably find an individual. A beast delivering a message typically covers 1 mile per hour walking, or 2 miles per hour if it can fly.

At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level, the duration of the spell increases to 24 hours. If you use a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can either increase the duration by another 24 hours for each slot level above 2nd or affect one additional beast for each slot level above 2nd.

## BLACK BOLT
1st-­level evocation 

Casting Time: 1 action 

Range: 120 ft. 

Components: V, S 

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You summon some measure of the darkness that plagues your soul and send it outwards as a bolt of blackness at a creature within range. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by the magic as it envelops them like shadowy tentacles. At the end of its turn, the creature can attempt a Strength saving throw to break free. If the creature’s size is larger than the caster’s it has advantage on the saving throw.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each level above 1st.

## Spirit Walk
1st-­level transmutation (ritual)

Casting Time: 1 minute

Range: Self

Components: V

Duration: 10 minutes

You project your spirit body into the border regions of the Ethereal Plane, in the area where it overlaps with your current plane. The material body you leave behind is unconscious. Your spirit body resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating your game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way home. If the cord is cut--something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it does--your soul and body are separated, killing you instantly.

You remain in the Border Ethereal for the duration or until you use your action to dismiss the spell. During this time, you can move in any direction. If you move up or down, every foot of movement costs an extra foot. You can see and hear the plane you originated from, but everything there looks gray, and you can't see anything more than 60 feet away. While on the Ethereal Plane, you can only affect and be affected by other creatures on that plane. Creatures that aren't on the Ethereal Plane can't perceive you and can't interact with you, unless a special ability or magic has given them the ability to do so. You ignore all objects and effects that aren't on the Ethereal Plane, allowing you to move through objects you perceive on the plane you originated from.

The spell ends for you when you use your action to dismiss it. The spell might also end early. A successful dispel magic spell used against your spirit form or material body ends the spell. If your material body or your spirit form drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. If the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the your spirit form back to your material body, and you awaken.
