# 3rd Level Spells

## ANATHEMA
3rd-­level abjuration (ritual)<br>
Casting Time: 10 minutes<br>
Range: Self<br>
Components: V, S<br>
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour<br>

This spell blocks harmful magics. While in effect you have advantage on saving throws against magical effects and resistance to damage from spells.

## Animate Dead	| Reanimation
3rd-level necromancy<br>
Classes: Cleric, Wizard<br>
Casting Time: 1 minute<br>
Range: 10 feet<br>
Components: V, S<br>
Duration: 24 hours<br>
Replaces: Animate Dead<br>

You channel necromantic energy to raise a corpse as an undead servant. Choose a pile of bones or corpse within range, which belonged in life to a humanoid of CR 2 or less. The target is raised as a skeleton or zombie, respectively, applying the Skeleton or Zombie template to its former stat block.

On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any or all minions you have created through this spell within 60 feet. You select an action for each creature and where it will move. If you issue no command, the creature moves to attack any creatures hostile to it or takes the Dodge action if it cannot detect any.

The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it becomes hostile to you and all living things. You can control a number of minions up to your proficiency bonus through this spell, but their combined CR cannot exceed 3, and you must wait 24 hours after creating one before you can create another. If you cast the spell while you have any controlled reanimated servants, you may renew the duration of their control rather than creating a new one.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the target's maximum CR increases by 1 for each slot level above 3rd. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of a 4th level or higher, you can also reanimate beast corpses. If you use a slot of 5th level or higher, you can reanimate giant or monstrosity corpses.

## Beacon of Hope	| Symbol of Resilience
3rd-level abjuration<br>
Classes: Cleric<br>
Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: Self<br>
Components: V, S<br>
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute<br>
Replaces: Beacon of Hope<br>

You create a tiny symbol above you, which radiates hope in a
30-foot radius until the spell ends. The symbol can take
whatever form you choose, such as that of your deity. As a
bonus action on your turn, you can move the symbol up to 30
feet.

Each nonhostile, living creature in the symbol's radius
(including you) has advantage on Wisdom saving throws,
adds your spellcasting ability modifier to its death saving
throws (treating rolls equal to or above 20 as a natural 20),
and regains the maximum number of hit points possible from
any healing.

The first time a nonhostile, living creature starts its turn in
the symbol's radius, it can use a bonus action to spend two
Hit Dice to regain hit points as if it had taken a short rest. If
the creature had fewer hit points than half its hit point
maximum, it also gains an equivalent number of temporary
hit points until the spell ends.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 4th level or higher, the amount of Hit Dice a creature
can spend increases by 1 for each slot level above 3rd.

## BESTOW CURSE*
3rd-­level necromancy<br>
Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: Touch<br>
Components: V, S<br>
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute<br>

You touch a creature, and that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become cursed for the duration of the spell. When you cast this spell, choose the nature of the curse from the following options:

- Choose one ability score. While cursed, the target has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability score.
- While cursed, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you.
- While cursed, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns. If it fails, it wastes its action that turn doing nothing.
- While the target is cursed, your attacks and spells deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target.

A remove curse spell ends this effect. At the GM’s discretion, you may invent a different curse effect, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The Game­master has final say on such a curse’s effect.

At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell at 4th level, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. If you cast it at 5th level, the duration is 8 hours. If you cast at 7th level, the duration is 24 hours. If you cast at 9th level, the spell lasts until it is dispelled. Casting at 5th level or higher grants a duration that doesn’t require concentration.

## BLINK
3rd-­level transmutation<br>
Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: Self<br>
Components: V, S<br>
Duration: 1 minute<br>

Roll a d20 at the end of each of your turns for the duration of the spell. On a roll of 11 or higher, you vanish from your current position and appear in the Yonderworld (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you were already there). At the start of your next turn, and when the spell ends if you are in the Yonderworld, you return to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of the space you vanished from. If no unoccupied space is available within that range, you appear in the nearest unoccupied space (chosen at random if more than one space is equally near). You can dismiss this spell as an action.

While in the Yonderworld, you can see and hear the place you originated from, which is cast in translucent shades of gray, and you can’t see anything there more than 60 feet away. You can only affect and be affected by other creatures in the Yonderworld. Creatures that aren’t there can’t perceive you or interact with you, unless they have the ability to do so.

## COUNTERSPELL*
3rd-­level abjuration<br>
Casting Time: 1 reaction (when a creature within range casts a spell)<br>
Range: 60 feet<br>
Components: S<br>
Duration: Instantaneous<br>

You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a success, the creature’s spell fails and has no effect.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 4th level or higher, the interrupted spell has no effect if its level is less than or equal to the level of the counterspell you cast.

## DISPEL MAGIC*
3rd-­level abjuration<br>
Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: 120 feet<br>
Components: V, S<br>
Duration: Instantaneous<br>

Choose one creature, object, or magical effect within range. Any spell of 3rd level or lower on the target ends. For each spell of 4th level or higher on the target, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a successful check, the spell ends.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 4th level or higher, you automatically end the effects of a spell on the target if the spell’s level is equal to or less than the level at which you cast dispel magic.

##	Fireball	| Fireblast
3rd-level evocation<br>
Classes: Sorcerer, Wizard<br>
Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: 120 feet<br>
Components: V, S, M (a bit of peat and quicklime)<br>
Duration: Instantaneous<br>
Replaces: Fireball<br>

A marble-sized ball of flame appears in your hand before
darting out and exploding at a point you choose within range.
Every creature within 20 feet of the point must make a
Dexterity saving throw, taking 7d6 fire damage on a failure of
half as much on a success.

The blast spreads around corners and ignites flammable
objects that aren't being worn or carried.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for
each slot level above 3rd.

## FLAMING SERVANT
3rd-­level conjuration, ritual<br>
Casting Time: 10 minutes<br>
Range: 10 feet<br>
Components: V, S, M (a suit of heavy armor)<br>
Duration: 8 hours<br>

You summon a creature of living fire to occupy a suit of armor that you provide. The summoned creature remains within 30 feet of you at all times and follows your commands. It shares your initiative count and you can use your bonus action to command it to take an action, such as attack a target. It can suppress its fiery nature to interact with objects normally or you can command it to use its action to set unattended flammable objects alight. If it is destroyed then you cannot summon the creature again until the next day.

|Summoned Creature.

Its challenge rating is dependent on the caster’s proficiency bonus (+1 to +3 = 1/2 CR, +4 to +5 = 1 CR).||||||
|ACTIONS<br><br>Sword of Flame. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) fire damage.||||||

## FLY*
3rd-­level transmutation<br>
Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: Touch<br>
Components: V, S, M (a wing feather from any bird)<br>
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes<br>

You touch a willing creature. The target gains a flying speed of 60 feet for the duration. When the spell ends, the target falls if it is still aloft, unless it can stop the fall.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each level above 3rd.

## GLYPH OF WARDING
3rd-­level abjuration<br>
Casting Time: 1 hour<br>
Range: Touch<br>
Components: V, S, M (incense and powdered diamond worth at least 100 thaler, which the spell consumes)<br>
Duration: Until dispelled or triggered<br>

When you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that later unleashes a magical effect. You inscribe it either on a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.

The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.

You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.

You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect only abominations). You can also set conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.

When you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.

- Explosive Runes. When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-­radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.
- Spell Glyph. You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive runes glyph increases by 1d8 for each level above 3rd. If you create a spell glyph, you can store any spell of up to the same level as you use for the glyph of warding.

## JUDGING BONDS
3rd-­level enchantment (ritual)<br>
Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: Touch<br>
Components: V, S<br>
Duration: 1 month<br>

You allow pacifying light to flow through the chains or shackles holding a person. This prevents that person from using mystical powers and provides disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity checks and saving throws while bound.

## LARVAE BOIL
3rd-­level conjuration<br>
Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: Touch<br>
Components: V, S, M (a live wasp)<br>
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute<br>

Drawing from the force of wrath you can infuse an enemy’s body with larvae that then start to eat their way out. Although it is loudly refuted by members of the court, persistent rumors say that this is how the hero king Ynedar met his demise.

On a successful melee spell attack, the victim is infected with larvae. At the end of its turn, it suffers 1d4 piercing damage. On the next round the damage increases to 1d6 piercing damage, on the third round the damage is 1d8, and on the fourth round it is 1d10 damage, and on the fifth and all following rounds it increases to 1d12 piercing damage.

At Higher Levels. If cast at 4th level, the victim takes 1d6 piercing damage on the first round, which increases each subsequent round, to a total of 1d12 piercing damage per round. At 5th level, the damage starts off at 1d8 on the first round, then at 6th level it starts at 1d10 piercing damage, and at 7th level it starts at 1d12 piercing damage.

##	Lightning Bolt	| Lightning Beam
3rd-level evocation<br>
Classes: Sorcerer, Wizard<br>
Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: Self (100-foot line)<br>
Components: V, S, M (a piece of quartz and a bit of fine dust)<br>
Duration: Instantaneous<br>
Replaces: Lightning Bolt<br>

A brilliant, blue-white beam of lightning flashes forth from
your fingertips, forming a line 100 feet long and 5 feet wide in
a direction you choose.

You can cause the beam to bounce once off of a solid,
nonconductive object that you can see (such as a stone wall)
in a new direction you choose if it has not reached its
maximum length. Each creature struck by the beam must
make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d12
lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on
a successful one, and cannot be damaged by the beam more
than once.

The lightning ignites flammable objects in the area that
aren't being worn or carried.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d12 for
each slot level above 3rd.

## MAGIC CIRCLE
3rd-­level abjuration<br>
Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: 15 feet<br>
Components: V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron worth at least 50 thaler, which the spell consumes)<br>
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour<br>

You draw a 10-foot radius circular glyph upon the ground,
which projects a 30-foot-tall cylinder of power upward. Glowing runes appear wherever the cylinder intersects with the floor or another surface. Choose one option: a) A mystic that knows the pattern to a permanent teleportation circle may communicate telepathically with the attendant of that circle (see The Chapter Circles of Ordo Magica below). Or b) Select one of the following creature types when you draw the glyph:
aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. 
A CR 5 or lower creature of the chosen type can't willingly move across the cylinder's boundary. When the creature attempts to make an attack, cast a spell, use teleportation or interplanar travel, or cause any other effect across the boundary, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the maximum CR of affected creatures increases by 3 for each slot level above 3rd. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th or 6th level, the duration is concentration, up to 12 hours. When cast using a spell slot of 7th or 8th level, the duration is concentration, up to 24 hours. When cast using a 9th-level spell slot, the duration is permanent and there is no CR limit on affected creatures.

##### The Chapter Circles of Ordo Magica

Each chapter of Ordo Magica has a permanent teleportation circle and these are more or less always manned by a bored and/or studying novice, making it possible to always reach the chapter telepathically.

Telepathy is the transmission of direct thought, with no opportunity for subtlety or dissembling, so wizards are generally reluctant to overuse telepathic communication, especially with mystics they do not know very well. Even with trusted colleagues, transmissions are kept as short as possible – on the crowded career ladder of Ordo Magica there is no room to give even a close friend any competitive advantage, if you can avoid it.

## MAJOR IMAGE
3rd-­level illusion<br>
Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: 120 feet<br>
Components: V, S, M (a bit of fleece)<br>
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutesv

You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can’t create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte’s stench).

As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 6th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring your concentration.

## MASS HEALING WORD*
3rd-­level evocation<br>
Casting Time: 1 bonus action<br>
Range: 60 feet<br>
Components: V<br>
Duration: Instantaneous<br>

As you call out words of restoration, up to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range regain hit points equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on constructs.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 4th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d4 for each level above 3rd.

## PURGING FIRE
3rd-­level evocation (ritual)<br>
Casting Time: 8 hours<br>
Range: Self<br>
Components: V, S, M (holy incense, 50 thaler worth)v
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute<br>

You prepare yourself with songs and prayers before climbing onto a burning pyre to cleanse your body of Corruption. Each round you remain in the fire you take 1d12 fire damage. If you do not lose concentration on the spell, you reduce your permanent Corruption by 1 point. You must take damage in order to reduce your Corruption. Thus you can remove up to 10 points of permanent Corruption if you remain in the pyre for the duration.

You cannot cast this spell for anyone else, only you may benefit from it.

## SPIRIT GUARDIANS*
3rd-­level conjuration<br>
Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: Self<br>
Components: V, S, M (a holy symbol)<br>
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes<br>

You call forth spirits to protect you. They flit around you to a distance of 15 feet for the duration. If you are blight-­stricken or uncorrupted, their spectral form appears angelic or fey (your choice). If you are blight-­marked, they appear fiendish.

When you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. An affected creature’s speed is halved in the area, and when the creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 radiant damage or 3d8 necrotic damage (if you are blight-­marked). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each level above 3rd.

## SUMMON DAEMON
3rd-­level conjuration (ritual)<br>
Casting Time: 10 minutes<br>
Range: Self<br>
Components: V, S, M (candles, dagger and golden bowl)<br>
Duration: Special<br>

You summon an abomination from the Yonderworld, a daemon. The creature resists your control and you must make a contested Charisma check to keep it under your control. If you fail and the daemon was not summoned into an inverted magic circle, the daemon is free to do as it likes (including attacking you or your allies) and is free to roam until it chooses to return to the Yonderworld (which it can do as an action) or it is destroyed. If it is trapped in an inverted magic circle it instead cannot move and returns to the Yonderworld at the end of the magic circle’s duration. You can talk to the daemon during this time, but it is under no compulsion to speak or to give you truthful answers.

If you succeed at the Charisma check then the daemon is under your control for 24 hours. If requested, it will return to the Yonderworld, which ends your control of it. It will also carry out your orders, unless they involve a clear danger to the daemon from the servants of Prios or another god. It takes its own turn and follows your commands.

When you cast this spell, you summon a Servant Daemon. If you choose to gain a point of permanent Corruption you can instead summon a Vindictive Daemon, for two points of permanent Corruption you can summon a Knowledge Daemon or for three points of permanent Corruption you can summon a Guardian Daemon. The stats for the daemons are included below.

##	Tiny Hut	| Arcane Shelter
3rd-level abjuration (ritual)<br>
Casting Time: 10 minutes<br>
Range: Self (10-foot dome)<br>
Components: V, S, M (a flake of tortoise shell)<br>
Duration: 8 hours<br>
Replaces: Tiny Hut<br>

You construct a 10-foot radius dome of arcane energy, centered on yourself. The dome is stationary and disappears if you exit its area. If you cast it in a location without enough space to accommodate it, the spell fails.

Ten Medium creatures can fit inside the dome; a Large creature takes as much space as four Medium creatures. You can designate up to ten creatures when you cast the spell who can freely pass in and out of the dome, taking 25 feet of movement to move through the dome. Other creatures cannot pass through.

The dome is translucent, with only vague shapes visible through it. Projectiles that touch the dome are slowed to a stop, and spells and other magical effects can't pass through the dome or be cast through it.

Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: 30 feet<br>
Components: V, S<br>
Duration: Instantaneous<br>
Replaces: Vampiric Touch<br>

You send tendrils of necrotic energy out, sucking the life essence from your foes. Select up to three creatures within range that aren't constructs or undead. Make a ranged spell attack against each, dealing 3d6 necrotic damage on a hit. You regain hit points equal to half the damage dealt.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each two slot levels above 5th.
