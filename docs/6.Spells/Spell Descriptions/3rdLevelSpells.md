# 3rd Level Spells

## ANATHEMA

3rd-­level abjuration (ritual)

Casting Time: 10 minutes

Range: Self

Components: V, S

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

This spell blocks harmful magics. While in effect you have advantage on saving throws against magical effects and resistance to damage from spells.

## ANIMATE DEAD*

3rd-­level necromancy, ritual

Casting Time: 1 hour

Range: 10 feet

Components: V, S, M (a drop of blood, a piece of flesh, and a pinch of bone dust)

Duration: Instantaneous

This spell creates an undead servant. Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a Medium or Small humanoid within range. Your spell imbues the target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The target becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or a zombie if you chose a corpse (the GM has the creature’s game statistics).

On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.

The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you’ve given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 4th level or higher, you animate or reassert control over two additional undead creatures for each level above 3rd. Each of the creatures must come from a different corpse or pile of bones.

## Arcane Shelter

3rd-level abjuration (ritual)

Casting Time: 10 minutes

Range: Self (10-foot dome)

Components: V, S, M (a flake of tortoise shell)

Duration: 8 hours

Replaces: Tiny Hut

You construct a 10-foot radius dome of arcane energy, centered on yourself. The dome is stationary and disappears if you exit its area. If you cast it in a location without enough space to accommodate it, the spell fails.

Ten Medium creatures can fit inside the dome; a Large creature takes as much space as four Medium creatures. You can designate up to ten creatures when you cast the spell who can freely pass in and out of the dome, taking 25 feet of movement to move through the dome. Other creatures cannot pass through.

The dome is translucent, with only vague shapes visible through it. Projectiles that touch the dome are slowed to a stop, and spells and other magical effects can't pass through the dome or be cast through it.

## BESTOW CURSE*

3rd-­level necromancy

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Touch

Components: V, S

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You touch a creature, and that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become cursed for the duration of the spell. When you cast this spell, choose the nature of the curse from the following options:

- Choose one ability score. While cursed, the target has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability score.
- While cursed, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you.
- While cursed, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns. If it fails, it wastes its action that turn doing nothing.
- While the target is cursed, your attacks and spells deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target.

A remove curse spell ends this effect. At the GM’s discretion, you may invent a different curse effect, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The Game­master has final say on such a curse’s effect.

At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell at 4th level, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. If you cast it at 5th level, the duration is 8 hours. If you cast at 7th level, the duration is 24 hours. If you cast at 9th level, the spell lasts until it is dispelled. Casting at 5th level or higher grants a duration that doesn’t require concentration.

## BLINK

Symbols carved on the ancient stone fundament on which the palace of Mergile is built, likely a curse aimed at the lords and ladies who once lived there.

3rd-­level transmutation

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Self

Components: V, S

Duration: 1 minute

Roll a d20 at the end of each of your turns for the duration of the spell. On a roll of 11 or higher, you vanish from your current position and appear in the Yonderworld (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you were already there). At the start of your next turn, and when the spell ends if you are in the Yonderworld, you return to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of the space you vanished from. If no unoccupied space is available within that range, you appear in the nearest unoccupied space (chosen at random if more than one space is equally near). You can dismiss this spell as an action.

While in the Yonderworld, you can see and hear the place you originated from, which is cast in translucent shades of gray, and you can’t see anything there more than 60 feet away. You can only affect and be affected by other creatures in the Yonderworld. Creatures that aren’t there can’t perceive you or interact with you, unless they have the ability to do so.

## COUNTERSPELL*

3rd-­level abjuration

Casting Time: 1 reaction (when a creature within range casts a spell)

Range: 60 feet

Components: S

Duration: Instantaneous

You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a success, the creature’s spell fails and has no effect.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 4th level or higher, the interrupted spell has no effect if its level is less than or equal to the level of the counterspell you cast.

## DISPEL MAGIC*

3rd-­level abjuration

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 120 feet

Components: V, S

Duration: Instantaneous

@Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-spells.xoU2QqIxAly3yiks]{Dispel Magic}

Choose one creature, object, or magical effect within range. Any spell of 3rd level or lower on the target ends. For each spell of 4th level or higher on the target, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a successful check, the spell ends.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 4th level or higher, you automatically end the effects of a spell on the target if the spell’s level is equal to or less than the level at which you cast dispel magic.

## FIREBALL*

3rd-­level evocation

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 150 feet

Components: V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)

Duration: Instantaneous

A bright streak flashes from your finger to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature in a 20-foot-­radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each level above 3rd.

## FLAMING SERVANT

3rd-­level conjuration, ritual

Casting Time: 10 minutes

Range: 10 feet

Components: V, S, M (a suit of heavy armor)

Duration: 8 hours

@Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-spells.79LetuTsYWvZ2NzC]{Flaming Servant}

You summon a creature of living fire to occupy a suit of armor that you provide. The summoned creature remains within 30 feet of you at all times and follows your commands. It shares your initiative count and you can use your bonus action to command it to take an action, such as attack a target. It can suppress its fiery nature to interact with objects normally or you can command it to use its action to set unattended flammable objects alight. If it is destroyed then you cannot summon the creature again until the next day.

## FLY*

3rd-­level transmutation

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Touch

Components: V, S, M (a wing feather from any bird)

Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You touch a willing creature. The target gains a flying speed of 60 feet for the duration. When the spell ends, the target falls if it is still aloft, unless it can stop the fall.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each level above 3rd.

## GLYPH OF WARDING

3rd-­level abjuration

Casting Time: 1 hour

Range: Touch

Components: V, S, M (incense and powdered diamond worth at least 100 thaler, which the spell consumes)

Duration: Until dispelled or triggered

When you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that later unleashes a magical effect. You inscribe it either on a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.

The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.

You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.

You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect only abominations). You can also set conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.

When you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.

- Explosive Runes. When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-­radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.
- Spell Glyph. You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive runes glyph increases by 1d8 for each level above 3rd. If you create a spell glyph, you can store any spell of up to the same level as you use for the glyph of warding.

## JUDGING BONDS

3rd-­level enchantment (ritual)

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Touch

Components: V, S

Duration: 1 month

You allow pacifying light to flow through the chains or shackles holding a person. This prevents that person from using mystical powers and provides disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity checks and saving throws while bound.

## LARVAE BOIL

3rd-­level conjuration

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Touch

Components: V, S, M (a live wasp)

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

Drawing from the force of wrath you can infuse an enemy’s body with larvae that then start to eat their way out. Although it is loudly refuted by members of the court, persistent rumors say that this is how the hero king Ynedar met his demise.

On a successful melee spell attack, the victim is infected with larvae. At the end of its turn, it suffers 1d4 piercing damage. On the next round the damage increases to 1d6 piercing damage, on the third round the damage is 1d8, and on the fourth round it is 1d10 damage, and on the fifth and all following rounds it increases to 1d12 piercing damage.

At Higher Levels. If cast at 4th level, the victim takes 1d6 piercing damage on the first round, which increases each subsequent round, to a total of 1d12 piercing damage per round. At 5th level, the damage starts off at 1d8 on the first round, then at 6th level it starts at 1d10 piercing damage, and at 7th level it starts at 1d12 piercing damage.

## LIGHTNING BOLT*

3rd-­level evocation

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Self

Components: V, S, M (a bit of fur and a rod of amber, crystal, or glass)

Duration: Instantaneous

A stroke of lightning forming a line 100 feet long and 5 feet wide blasts out from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The lightning ignites flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each level above 3rd.

## MAGIC CIRCLE

3rd-­level abjuration

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 10 feet

Components: V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron worth at least 50 thaler, which the spell consumes)

Duration: 1 hour

You create a 10-foot-­radius, 20-foot-­tall cylinder of magical energy centered on a point on the ground that you can see within range. Glowing runes appear wherever the cylinder intersects with the floor or another surface. Choose one option: a) A mystic that knows the pattern to a permanent teleportation circle may communicate telepathically with the attendant of that circle (see The Chapter Circles of Ordo Magica below). Or b) Choose one or more of the following types of creatures: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or phenomenons. The circle affects a creature of the chosen type in the following ways:

- The creature can’t willingly enter the cylinder by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw.
- The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets within the cylinder.
- Targets within the cylinder can’t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by the creature.

When you choose this option, you can elect to cause its magic to operate in the reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the cylinder and protecting targets outside it.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 4th level or higher, the duration increases by 1 hour for each level above 3rd.

##### The Chapter Circles of Ordo Magica

Each chapter of Ordo Magica has a permanent teleportation circle and these are more or less always manned by a bored and/or studying novice, making it possible to always reach the chapter telepathically.

Telepathy is the transmission of direct thought, with no opportunity for subtlety or dissembling, so wizards are generally reluctant to overuse telepathic communication, especially with mystics they do not know very well. Even with trusted colleagues, transmissions are kept as short as possible – on the crowded career ladder of Ordo Magica there is no room to give even a close friend any competitive advantage, if you can avoid it.

## MAJOR IMAGE

3rd-­level illusion

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 120 feet

Components: V, S, M (a bit of fleece)

Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can’t create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte’s stench).

As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 6th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring your concentration.

## MASS HEALING WORD*

3rd-­level evocation

Casting Time: 1 bonus action

Range: 60 feet

Components: V

Duration: Instantaneous

As you call out words of restoration, up to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range regain hit points equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on constructs.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 4th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d4 for each level above 3rd.

## PURGING FIRE

3rd-­level evocation (ritual)

Casting Time: 8 hours

Range: S
