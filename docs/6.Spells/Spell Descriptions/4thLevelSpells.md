## Banishment	| Expulsion
4th-­level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 ft.
Components: V, S, M (an item distasteful to the target)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to send one creature that you can see within range to another plane of existence. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished.

If the target is native to the plane of existence you’re on, you banish the target to a harmless demiplane. While there, the target is incapacitated. The target remains there until the spell ends, at which point the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

If the target is native to a different plane of existence (such as a fiend) than the one you’re on, the target is banished with a faint popping noise, returning to its home plane. If the spell ends before 1 minute has passed, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. Otherwise, the target doesn’t return.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each level above 4th.

## BLIGHT*
4th-­level necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 ft.
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous

Necromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can see within range, draining moisture and vitality from it. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. The target takes 8d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

If you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it.

If you target a nonmagical plant that isn’t a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it doesn’t make a saving throw; it simply withers and dies.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each level above 4th.

## Confusion	| Bewilder
4th-­level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 90 ft.
Components: V, S, M (three nut shells)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

This spell assaults and twists creatures’ minds, spawning delusions and provoking uncontrolled action. Each creature in a 10-foot-­radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.

An affected target can’t take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.

At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 5th level or higher, the radius of the sphere increases by 5 feet for each level above 4th.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|1d10|Behavior|
|1|The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) to each die face. The creature doesn’t take an action this turn.|
|2–6|The creature doesn’t move or take actions this turn.|
|7–8|The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn.|
|9–10|The creature can act and move normally.|

## Dominate Beast	| Command Beast
4th-­level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 ft.
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to beguile a beast that you can see within range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.

While the beast is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as “Attack that creature,” “Run over there,” or “Fetch that object.” If the creature completes the order and doesn’t receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.

You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn’t do anything that you don’t allow it to do. During this time, you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.

Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 5th-­level, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. When you cast at 6th-­level, the duration is concentration, up to 1 hour. When you cast at 7th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours.

##	Faithful Hound	| Unerring Sentry


##	Ice Storm	| Hailstorm
4th-­level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 300 ft.
Components: V, S, M (a pinch of dust and a few drops of water)
Duration: Instantaneous

A hail of rock-­hard ice pounds to the ground in a 20-foot-­radius, 40-foot-­high cylinder centered on a point within range. Each creature in the cylinder must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 4d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Hailstones turn the storm’s area of effect into difficult terrain until the end of your next turn.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 5th level or higher, the bludgeoning damage increases by 1d8 for each level above 4th.

## ILLUSORY CORRECTION
4th-­level illusion
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 ft.
Components: V
Duration: Special

There are gaps between reality and our perception of it. By casting this spell, the mystic takes advantage of these discrepancies. While this spell is active, when you or another creature within range makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw you can use your reaction to make a correction of reality, either forcing another creature to reroll the d20 or allowing yourself to do so.

At the end of your turn if you have used your reaction since your previous turn, you must make a spellcasting ability check to keep track of the differences between your personal reality and that which others perceive. The DC starts at 5 and increases each time by 5. If you fail the check the spell immediately ends (you cannot use your reaction to reroll).

##	Geas	Injunction


## LIFEGIVER
4th-­level evocation (ritual)
Casting Time: 1 hour
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous

As you cast this spell, you touch a number of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus. You can be one of those creatures. Each creature’s temporary Corruption is reduced by 1d4. Any excess points restore the creature’s hit points.

At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell at 5th level or higher, you can heal one additional creature per spell level.

##	Phantasmal Killer	| Phantasmal Horror
4th-­level illusion
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 ft.
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can see within range and create an illusory manifestation of its deepest fears, visible only to that creature. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes frightened for the duration. At the end of each of the target’s turns before the spell ends, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each level above 4th.

##	Polymorph	| Animal Transformation


## PRIVATE SANCTUM
4th-­level abjuration
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: 120 ft.
Components: V, S, M (a thin sheet of lead, a piece of opaque glass, a wad of cotton or cloth, and powdered chrysolite)
Duration: 24 hours

You make an area within range magically secure. The area is a cube that can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The spell lasts for the duration or until you use an action to dismiss it.

When you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell provides, choosing any or all of the following properties:

- Sound can’t pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded area.
- The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing vision (including darkvision) through it.
- Sensors created by divination spells can’t appear inside the protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter.
- Creatures in the area can’t be targeted by divination spells.
- Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area.
- Planar travel is blocked within the warded area.

Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 5th level or higher, you can increase the size of the cube by 100 feet for each level beyond 4th. Thus you could protect a cube that can be up to 200 feet on one side by casting this spell at 5th level.

## WALL OF FIRE
4th-­level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 ft.
Components: V, S, M (a small piece of phosphorus)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a wall of fire on a solid surface within range. You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is opaque and lasts for the duration.

When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.

Either the inside or outside of the wall, selected by you when you cast this spell, deals 5d8 fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of the selected side. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each level above 4th.
