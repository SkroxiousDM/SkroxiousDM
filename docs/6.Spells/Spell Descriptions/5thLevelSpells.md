ANIMATE OBJECTS

5th-­level transmutation

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 120 ft.

Components: V, S

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.ATo0Eb63TDtnu6iA]{Animate Objects}

Objects come to life at your command. Choose up to ten nonmagical objects within range that are not being worn or carried. Medium targets count as two objects, Large targets count as four objects, Huge targets count as eight objects. You can’t animate any object larger than Huge. Each target animates and becomes a creature under your control until the spell ends or until reduced to 0 hit points.

As a bonus action, you can mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.

An animated object is a construct with AC, hit points, attacks, Strength, and Dexterity determined by its size. Its Constitution is 10 and its Intelligence and Wisdom are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its speed is 30 feet; if the object lacks legs or other appendages it can use for locomotion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. If the object is securely attached to a surface or a larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0. It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond that distance. When the animated object drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original object form, and any remaining damage carries over to its original object form.

When you command an object to attack, it can make a single melee attack during your turn against a creature within 5 feet of it. It makes a slam attack with an attack bonus and bludgeoning damage determined by its size. The GM might rule that a specific object inflicts slashing or piercing damage based on its form.

At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell at 6th level or higher, you can animate two additional objects for each level above 5th.

|   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Size|HP|AC|Str|Dex|Attack|
|Tiny|20|18|4 (−3)|18 (+4)|+8 to hit, 6 (1d4 + 4) damage|
|Small|25|16|6 (−2)|14 (+2)|+6 to hit, 6 (1d8 + 2) damage|
|Medium|40|13|10 (+0)|12 (+1)|+5 to hit, 8 (2d6 + 1) damage|
|Large|50|10|14 (+2)|10 (+0)|+6 to hit, 13 (2d10 + 2) damage|
|Huge|80|10|18 (+4)|6 (−2)|+8 to hit, 17 (2d12 + 4) damage|

ARCANE HAND

5th-­level evocation

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 120 ft.

Components: V, S, M (an eggshell and a snakeskin glove)

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.a2KJHCIbY5Mi4Dmn]{Arcane Hand}

You create a Large hand of shimmering, translucent force in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The hand lasts for the spell’s duration, and it moves at your command, mimicking the movements of your own hand.

The hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit point maximum. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. It has a Strength of 26 (+8) and a Dexterity of 10 (+0). The hand doesn’t fill its space. When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following effects with it:

- Clenched Fist. The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand using your game statistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage.
- Forceful Hand. The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose. Make a check with the hand’s Strength contested by the Strength (Athletics) check of the target. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it.
- Grasping Hand. The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand’s Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. While the hand is grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to have the hand crush it. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier.
- Interposing Hand. The hand interposes itself between you and a creature you choose until you give the hand a different command. The hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half cover against the target. The target can’t move through the hand’s space if its Strength score is less than or equal to the hand’s Strength score. If its Strength score is higher than the hand’s Strength score, the target can move toward you through the hand’s space, but that space counts as difficult terrain for the target.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 6th level or higher, the damage from the clenched fist option increases by 2d8, the damage from the grasping hand increases by 2d6, the Strength for the forceful hand increases by 2 for each level above 5th.

CLOUDKILL

5th-­level conjuration

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 120 ft.

Components: V, S

Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.LkvI11Uue774QBKZ]{Cloudkill}

You create a 20-foot-­radius sphere of poisonous, yellow-­green fog centered on a point you choose within range. The fog spreads around corners. It lasts for the duration or until a strong wind disperses the fog, ending the spell. Its area is heavily obscured.

When a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 5d8 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don’t need to breathe.

The fog moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns, rolling along the surface of the ground. The vapors, being heavier than air, sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down openings.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each level above 5th.

COMMUNE WITH SPIRITS*

5th-­level divination (ritual)

Casting Time: 10 minutes

Range: Self

Components: V, S

Duration: Special

@Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-spells.tl6VfSMKaVsxnn8j]{Commune with Spirits}

The world is old and many spirits linger from days past; nature spirits in dirt and water, or dead heroes who have not yet passed over to the other side. You contact these spirits and ask for their help. This help takes one of the following three forms:

- You can ask the spirits what important thing occurred here in the past. Note that spirits have a very limited understanding of time, so a battle that occurred 500 years ago might be more interesting to them than the murder that happened yesterday.
- You can ask them three yes or no questions that they will try to answer as accurately as possible. However, they are limited by their knowledge and won’t do well with questions outside their own experiences.
- You can name or describe an enemy. For the next 24 hours if that enemy approaches within 30 feet of your current location the spirits will attack them. At the start of its turn each specified creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure they become frightened of the area and take 1d6 psychic damage. On a success they are not frightened but still take 1d6 psychic damage.

CONE OF COLD

5th-­level evocation

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Self

Components: V, S, M (a small crystal or glass cone)

Duration: Instantaneous

@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.RpKjTlYASrfqUPVA]{Cone of Cold}

A blast of cold air erupts from your hands. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 8d8 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

A creature killed by this spell becomes a frozen statue until it thaws.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each level above 5th.

CREATION

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Material|Duration|
|Vegetable matter|1 day|
|Stone or crystal|12 hours|
|Precious metals|1 hour|
|Gems|10 minutes|
|Adamantine or mithral|1 minute|

5th-­level illusion

Casting Time: 1 minute

Range: 30 ft.

Components: V, S, M (a tiny piece of matter of the same type as the item you plan to create)

Duration: Special

@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.lnaGnxMzpYnbw1uU]{Creation}

You pull wisps of shadow material from the surroundings to create a nonliving object of vegetable matter within range: soft goods, rope, wood, or something similar. You can also use this spell to create mineral objects such as stone, crystal, or metal. The object created must be no larger than a 5-foot cube, and the object must be of a form and material that you have seen before.

The duration depends on the object’s material. If the object is composed of multiple materials, use the shortest duration. Using any material created by this spell as another spell’s material component causes that spell to fail.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 6th level or higher, the cube increases by 5 feet for each level above 5th.

DISPEL EVIL AND GOOD*

5th-­level abjuration

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 120 ft.

Components: V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron)

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

@Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-spells.o0ROO26mNKevlhXc]{Dispel Evil and Good}

Shimmering energy surrounds and protects you from abominations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or phenomenons, providing disadvantage on their attack rolls against you.

You can end the spell early by using the following special function:

- Break Enchantment. As your action, you touch a creature you can reach that is charmed, frightened, or possessed by an abomination, a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend. The creature you touch is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed by such creatures.

DOMINATE PERSON*

5th-­level enchantment

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 60 ft.

Components: V, S

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

@Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-spells.1kT0DjUzkv3MUXjJ]{Dominate Person}

You attempt to beguile a humanoid that you can see within range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.

While the target is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as “Attack that creature,” “Run over there,” or “Fetch that object.” If the creature completes the order and doesn’t receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.

You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn’t do anything that you don’t allow it to do. During this time you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.

Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 6th-­level, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. When you cast at 7th-­level, the duration is concentration, up to 1 hour. When you cast the spell at 8th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours.

EXORCISM

5th-­level transmutation, ritual

Casting Time: 1 hour

Range: 30 feet

Components: V, S, M (sprinkler of holy water)

Duration: Instantaneous

@Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-spells.RNOpk0FGq5qIu7kw]{Exorcism}

You call out to Prios to purge the immediate area of any creature that is not native to the material world and anoint everything else with his holy water. At the end of the casting time, each extraplanar creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you can see the creature as you cast the spell (for example it is trapped within a magic circle or otherwise confined) then it has disadvantage on its saving throw. An exorcised creature cannot return to the material world until at least 24 hours have passed.

FIRE SOUL

5th-­level transmutation, ritual

Casting Time: 10 minutes

Range: Self

Components: V, S, M (pinch of ash)

Duration: 1 hour

@Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-spells.jyRdZpt3bgT0nNZE]{Fire Soul}

Your eyes glow with a red light and you become extraordinarily hot to the touch. Creatures that touch you or attack you from within five feet take 6 (1d12) fire damage. You are immune to fire damage and the first time you take fire damage you instead regain hit points equal to half the damage you would have taken, rounded down.

FLAME STRIKE*

5th-­level evocation

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 60 ft.

Components: V, S, M (pinch of sulfur)

Duration: Instantaneous

@Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-spells.GYjF1BofAD66I1C4]{Flame Strike}

A vertical column of divine fire roars down from the heavens in a location you specify. Each creature in a 10-foot-­radius, 40-foot-­high cylinder centered on a point within range must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d6 fire damage and 4d6 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 6th level or higher, the fire damage or the radiant damage (your choice) increases by 1d6 for each level above 5th.

GEAS*

5th-­level enchantment

Casting Time: 1 minute

Range: 60 ft.

Components: V

Duration: 30 days

@Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-spells.XmmRdDTtx84xMbz1]{Geas}

You place a magical command on a creature that you can see within range, forcing it to carry out some service or refrain from some action or activity as you decide. If the creature can understand you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While the creature is charmed by you, it takes 5d10 psychic damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions, but no more than once each day. A creature that can’t understand you is unaffected by the spell.

You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell ends.

You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. A remove curse, greater restoration, or wish spell also ends it.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 7th or 8th level, the duration is 1 year. When you cast this spell at 9th level, the spell lasts until it is ended by one of the spells mentioned above.

HOLD MONSTER*

5th-­level enchantment

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 90 ft.

Components: V, S, M (a small, straight piece of iron)

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

@Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-spells.xWq7Z65J0VzjaC7b]{Hold Monster}

Choose a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be paralyzed for the duration. This spell has no effect on undead. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 6th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each level above 5th. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

INSECT PLAGUE

5th-­level conjuration

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 300 ft.

Components: V, S, M

Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.OVikYmSdHliAG2YD]{Insect Plague}

Swarming, biting locusts fill a 20-foot-­radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere spreads around corners. The sphere remains for the duration, and its area is lightly obscured. The sphere’s area is difficult terrain.

When the locusts appears, each creature within the area of the sphere must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 4d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each level above 5th.

MASS CURE WOUNDS*

5th-­level evocation

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 60 ft.

Components: V, S

Duration: Instantaneous

@Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-spells.HWdt3RD6XdvlQZrB]{Mass Cure Wounds}

A wave of healing energy washes out from a point of your choice within range. Choose up to six creatures in a 30-foot-­radius sphere centered on that point. Each target regains hit points equal to 3d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on constructs.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 6th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each level above 5th.

MODIFY MEMORY*

5th-­level enchantment

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 30 ft.

Components: V, S

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

@Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-spells.qMrLAdTlRCPnJRzi]{Modify Memory}

You attempt to reshape another creature’s memories. One creature that you can see must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes charmed by you for the duration. The charmed target is incapacitated and unaware of its surroundings, though it can still hear you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends, and none of the target’s memories are modified.

While this charm lasts, you can affect the target’s memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event.

You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you have finished describing the modified memories, the creature’s memory isn’t altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.

A modified memory doesn’t necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature’s natural inclinations or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The GM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant manner.

A remove curse or greater restoration spell cast on the target restores the creature’s true memory.

At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell at 6th level or higher, you can alter the target’s memories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago (6th level), 30 days ago (7th level), 1 year ago (8th level), or any time in the creature’s past (9th level).

PLANAR BINDING*

5th-­level abjuration

Casting Time: 1 hour

Range: 60 ft.

Components: V, S, M (a jewel worth at least 1,000 thaler, which the spell consumes)

Duration: 24 hours

@Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-spells.enO3LuTeWLvuB4DT]{Planar Binding}

With this spell, you attempt to bind a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend to your service. The creature must be within range for the entire casting of the spell. (Typically, the creature is first summoned into the center of an inverted magic circle in order to keep it trapped while this spell is cast.) At the completion of the casting, the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it is bound to serve you for the duration. If the creature was summoned or created by another spell, that spell’s duration is extended to match the duration of this spell.

A bound creature must follow your instructions to the best of its ability. You might command the creature to accompany you on an adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. The creature obeys the letter of your instructions, but if the creature is hostile to you, it strives to twist your words to achieve its own objectives. If the creature carries out your instructions completely before the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you are on the same plane of existence. If you are on a different plane of existence, it returns to the place where you bound it and remains there until the spell ends.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at a higher level, the duration increases to 10 days at 6th level, to 30 days at 7th- level, to 180 days at 8th level, and to a year and a day at 9th level.

PURGATORY

5th-­level evocation (ritual)

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 30 ft.

Components: V, S, M (short piece of rusty chain)

Duration: Instantaneous

@Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-spells.6qmTdeP2bvQY741f]{Purgatory}

You choose a creature within range, it must make a Wisdom saving throw with its current total Corruption as the DC. For thoroughly corrupt creatures the DC is 30. On a failure, the target takes 8d6 radiant damage or half that amount on a success.

At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell at 6th level or higher, you can target an additional creature for each level above 5th.

# Regenerate*

5th-level transmutation (ritual)

Casting Time: 1 minute

Range: touch

Components: V, S, M (a prayer wheel, holy water, and healing potions worth at least 500 gold, which the spell consumes)

Duration: 1 hour

You touch a creature and stimulate its natural healing ability. The target regains 4d8 + 15 vigour points. For the duration of the spell, the target regains 1 vigor point at the start of each of its turns (10 vigor points each minute).

The target’s severed body members (fingers, legs, tails, and so on), if any, are restored after 1 hour. If you have the severed part and hold it to the stump, the spell instantaneously causes the limb to knit to the stump. This spell does not heal any injury or scar that is older than one week.

This spell replaces the 7th level version.

TURN WEATHER

5th-­level transmutation

Casting Time: 10 minutes

Range: Self

Components: V, S

Duration: Concentration, up to 8 

@Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-spells.AwM9h3nXRagiQmOC]{Turn Weather}

You influence the weather within 5 miles of you for the duration. You must be outdoors to cast this spell. Moving to a place where you don’t have a clear path to the sky ends the spell early.

When you cast the spell, you change one of the current weather conditions, which are determined by the GM based on climate and season. You can change one of the following: precipitation, temperature, or wind. It takes 1d4 × 10 minutes for the new condition to take effect. Once it does so, you can change one of the conditions (the same or another) again. When the spell ends, the weather gradually returns to normal.

When you change a weather condition, find the current condition on the following tables and change its stage by one, up or down. When changing the winds, you can change its direction by one step (for example, from north to north-­east or from south-­west to south, etc.).


|   | Precipation |
|---|---|
|Stage|Condition|
|1|Clear|
|2|Light clouds|
