# 5th Level Spells

## Animate Objects |	Command Objects
5th-level transmutation<br>
Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: 60 feet<br>
Components: V, S<br>
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute<br>
Replaces: Animate Objects<br>

You magically animate nearby objects, bending them to
your will. Choose up to six nonmagical objects within range
that are not being worn or carried. All objects must be the
same size, and you can animate six Tiny, four Small, three
Medium, two Large, or one Huge object(s). Each object
animates until spell ends or until reduced to 0 hit points;
when an object drops to 0 hit points, any remaining damage
carries over to its original object form.

#### Command Objects Statistics

|Size |HP |AC |Str |Dex |Damage |Speed|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|Tiny |5 |19 |12 |28 |1d4 + 1 damage |fly 30 (hover)|
|Small |10 |18 |16 |24 |1d6 + 3 damage |fly 30|
|Medium |20 |17 |20 |20 |1d10 + 5 damage |30|
|Large |30 |16 |24 |16 |2d10 + 7 damage |25|
|Huge |60 |15 |28 |12 |5d12 + 9 damage |20|

An animated object has 30 feet of blindsight and statistics
as shown in the table above. The DM might rule an object has
immunities, resistances, and vulnerabilities to specific
damage types based on its form. If an object is securely
attached to a surface or a larger object, such as a chain bolted
to a wall, its speed is 0.

In combat, an object shares your initiative count, but take
its turn immediately after yours.

As a bonus action, you can issue one command to any
number of objects within the spell's range, otherwise, the
only action an object takes on its turn is the Dodge action. An
object may also be commanded to attempt an action available
to all creatures, such as grapple or shove, if its form permits
it to do so.

If commanded to attack, an object makes one melee attack
against the target you specify within 5 feet of it. Its attack
bonus is equal to your spell attack modifier. An object usually
deals bludgeoning damage, but the DM might rule it inflicts
slashing or piercing based on its form.

## Dispel Evil and Good	| Sacred Circle
5th-level abjuration<br>
Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: 60 feet<br>
Components: V, S, M (a piece of turquoise mounted in silver)<br>
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes<br>
Replaces: Dispel Evil and Good<br>

You create a 60-foot radius, 120-foot-tall cylinder of
resonating planar energy centered on a point on the ground
that you can see within range. Until the spell ends,
aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead
have disadvantage on attack rolls against three creatures of
your choice within the cylinder.

As an action, you may remove any charm, fear, or
possession effects caused by creatures of those types from a
creature of your choice within the cylinder.
Additionally, you can choose whether to allow or block
teleportation, interplanar travel, or creatures being
summoned within the cylinder.

## 	Legend Lore	| Unearth Legend
5th-level divination (ritual)<br>
Casting Time: 10 minutes<br>
Range: Self<br>
Components: V, S, M (rare gems worth at least 250 gp,
which the spell consumes, and a jeweled notebook worth at
least 200 gp)<br>
Duration: 1 week<br>
Replaces: Legend Lore<br>

You contact an otherworldly entity, offering it the gems used
in the spell's casting in exchange for the history of a person,
place, or object. The entity tells you everything it knows about
the subject (typically well-known lore or widely-told stories).
After it is contacted, the entity researches the subject for up
to 1 week. Its discoveries appear as writing in the jeweled
notebook. It might learn obscure myths, forgotten legends, or
even lost secrets. The more information you possess when
you cast the spell, the faster and more detailed the results will
be. The entity may not understand the information it finds,
and so might impart unsolved riddles, confusing poems, or
other puzzling communications. Once the entity has
conveyed everything it can discover, the spell ends.

##	Mislead	| Misdirection
5th-level illusion<br>
Casting Time: 1 action or 1 reaction, which you take when you are hit by an attack<br>
Range: Self<br>
Components: S<br>
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes<br>
Replaces: Mislead<br>

As an action, or as a reaction when you are hit by an attack,
you become invisible and hidden and create an illusory
double of yourself in your space. The double can move at
your speed, can gesture or speak as you choose, and mimics
any action you take (your attacks or spells appear to originate
from the double). The double has the same armor class as you.

Any time a creature would damage the double, or perceives
the double making an attack or casting a spell, it makes an
Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.
If the check succeeds, it realizes the double is an illusion and
you are no longer invisible to that creature.

As an action, you can use the double's senses instead of
your own until you use your action to return to your normal
senses. While you do so, you are blinded and deafened to
your own surroundings.

##	Telekinesis	| Psychokinesis
5th-level transmutation<br>
Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: 60 feet<br>
Components: V, S<br>
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes<br>
Replaces: Telekinesis<br>

You attempt to mentally manipulate a creature or object you
can see within range. When you cast the spell, you can cause
one of the following effects.

Creature. You attempt to move a Huge or smaller
creature, including yourself. The creature must make a
Strength saving throw. A creature can willingly fail this
save. On a failed save, you move the creature up to 30 feet
in any direction within the spell's range. You may restrain
the creature until the end of your next turn.

Object. You attempt to move an object that weighs up to
1,000 pounds and can exert fine control on it. If the object
isn't being worn or carried, you move it up to 30 feet in any
direction within the spell's range. If the object is worn or
carried by a creature, the creature must make a Strength
saving throw. On a failed save, you pull the object away
from that creature and can move it up to 30 feet in any
direction within the spell's range.

A creature or object moved into mid-air will hover.
On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use
an action to attempt to continue the effect or choose a new
target. You can only affect one object or creature at a time.

##	Wall of Force	| Arcane Wall
5th-level evocation<br>
Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: 120 feet<br>
Components: V, S, M (a pinch of powdered gemstone)<br>
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes<br>
Replaces: Wall of Force

An invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you
choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you
choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It
can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can
form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius
of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of
ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous
with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. It
lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature's
space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of
the wall (your choice which side).

Nothing can physically pass through the wall. Each panel
has an AC of 10 + the spell's level (15) and has 20 hit points
per level of spell (100). The wall can't be dispelled by dispel
magic, and is immune to psychic and nonmagical
bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. A disintegrate
spell destroys the wall instantly, however. The wall also
extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel
through the wall.

## ARCANE HAND
5th-­level evocation<br>
Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: 120 ft.<br>
Components: V, S, M (an eggshell and a snakeskin glove)<br>
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute<br>

You create a Large hand of shimmering, translucent force in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The hand lasts for the spell’s duration, and it moves at your command, mimicking the movements of your own hand.

The hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit point maximum. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. It has a Strength of 26 (+8) and a Dexterity of 10 (+0). The hand doesn’t fill its space. When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following effects with it:

- Clenched Fist. The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand using your game statistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage.
- Forceful Hand. The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose. Make a check with the hand’s Strength contested by the Strength (Athletics) check of the target. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it.
- Grasping Hand. The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand’s Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. While the hand is grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to have the hand crush it. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier.
- Interposing Hand. The hand interposes itself between you and a creature you choose until you give the hand a different command. The hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half cover against the target. The target can’t move through the hand’s space if its Strength score is less than or equal to the hand’s Strength score. If its Strength score is higher than the hand’s Strength score, the target can move toward you through the hand’s space, but that space counts as difficult terrain for the target.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 6th level or higher, the damage from the clenched fist option increases by 2d8, the damage from the grasping hand increases by 2d6, the Strength for the forceful hand increases by 2 for each level above 5th.

## CLOUDKILL
5th-­level conjuration<br>
Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: 120 ft.<br>
Components: V, S<br>
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes<br>

You create a 20-foot-­radius sphere of poisonous, yellow-­green fog centered on a point you choose within range. The fog spreads around corners. It lasts for the duration or until a strong wind disperses the fog, ending the spell. Its area is heavily obscured.

When a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 5d8 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don’t need to breathe.

The fog moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns, rolling along the surface of the ground. The vapors, being heavier than air, sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down openings.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each level above 5th.

## COMMUNE WITH SPIRITS*
5th-­level divination (ritual)<br>
Casting Time: 10 minutes<br>
Range: Self<br>
Components: V, S<br>
Duration: Special<br>

The world is old and many spirits linger from days past; nature spirits in dirt and water, or dead heroes who have not yet passed over to the other side. You contact these spirits and ask for their help. This help takes one of the following three forms:

- You can ask the spirits what important thing occurred here in the past. Note that spirits have a very limited understanding of time, so a battle that occurred 500 years ago might be more interesting to them than the murder that happened yesterday.
- You can ask them three yes or no questions that they will try to answer as accurately as possible. However, they are limited by their knowledge and won’t do well with questions outside their own experiences.
- You can name or describe an enemy. For the next 24 hours if that enemy approaches within 30 feet of your current location the spirits will attack them. At the start of its turn each specified creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure they become frightened of the area and take 1d6 psychic damage. On a success they are not frightened but still take 1d6 psychic damage.

## CONE OF COLD
5th-­level evocation<br>
Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: Self<br>
Components: V, S, M (a small crystal or glass cone)<br>
Duration: Instantaneous<br>

A blast of cold air erupts from your hands. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 8d8 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

A creature killed by this spell becomes a frozen statue until it thaws.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each level above 5th.

## CREATION
5th-­level illusion<br>
Casting Time: 1 minute<br>
Range: 30 ft.<br>
Components: V, S, M (a tiny piece of matter of the same type as the item you plan to create)<br>
Duration: Special<br>

|Material|Duration|
|---|---|
|Vegetable matter|1 day|
|Stone or crystal|12 hours|
|Precious metals|1 hour|
|Gems|10 minutes|
|Adamantine or mithral|1 minute|

You pull wisps of shadow material from the surroundings to create a nonliving object of vegetable matter within range: soft goods, rope, wood, or something similar. You can also use this spell to create mineral objects such as stone, crystal, or metal. The object created must be no larger than a 5-foot cube, and the object must be of a form and material that you have seen before.

The duration depends on the object’s material. If the object is composed of multiple materials, use the shortest duration. Using any material created by this spell as another spell’s material component causes that spell to fail.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 6th level or higher, the cube increases by 5 feet for each level above 5th.

## Dispel Evil and Good	| Sacred Circle
5th-­level abjuration<br>
Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: 120 ft.<br>
Components: V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron)<br>
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute<br>

Shimmering energy surrounds and protects you from abominations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or phenomenons, providing disadvantage on their attack rolls against you.

You can end the spell early by using the following special function:

- Break Enchantment. As your action, you touch a creature you can reach that is charmed, frightened, or possessed by an abomination, a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend. The creature you touch is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed by such creatures.

## DOMINATE PERSON*
5th-­level enchantment<br>
Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: 60 ft.<br>
Components: V, S<br>
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute<br>

You attempt to beguile a humanoid that you can see within range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.

While the target is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as “Attack that creature,” “Run over there,” or “Fetch that object.” If the creature completes the order and doesn’t receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.

You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn’t do anything that you don’t allow it to do. During this time you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.

Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 6th-­level, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. When you cast at 7th-­level, the duration is concentration, up to 1 hour. When you cast the spell at 8th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours.

## EXORCISM
5th-­level transmutation, ritual<br>
Casting Time: 1 hour<br>
Range: 30 feet<br>
Components: V, S, M (sprinkler of holy water)<br>
Duration: Instantaneous<br>

You call out to Prios to purge the immediate area of any creature that is not native to the material world and anoint everything else with his holy water. At the end of the casting time, each extraplanar creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you can see the creature as you cast the spell (for example it is trapped within a magic circle or otherwise confined) then it has disadvantage on its saving throw. An exorcised creature cannot return to the material world until at least 24 hours have passed.

## FIRE SOUL
5th-­level transmutation, ritual<br>
Casting Time: 10 minutes<br>
Range: Self<br>
Components: V, S, M (pinch of ash)<br>
Duration: 1 hour<br>

Your eyes glow with a red light and you become extraordinarily hot to the touch. Creatures that touch you or attack you from within five feet take 6 (1d12) fire damage. You are immune to fire damage and the first time you take fire damage you instead regain hit points equal to half the damage you would have taken, rounded down.

## Flame Strike	| Holy Fire
5th-level evocation<br>
Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: 60 feet<br>
Components: V, S, M (a pinch of ash from burnt incense)<br>
Duration: Instantaneous<br>
Replaces: Flame Strike<br>

A column of holy fire roars down from the heavens to smite
your foes, striking all creatures within a 40-foot high, 10-foot
radius cylinder. When you cast this spell, choose if it deals
radiant damage, fire damage, or both. All creatures within the
cylinder must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature
takes 8d8 damage of the chosen type (4d8 of each type if both
were selected) on a failed save, or half as much on a success.

Targets gain no benefit from cover for this saving throw.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 2d8 (or
1d8 of each type) for each two slot levels above 5th.

##	Geas	| Injunction
5th-level enchantment<br>
Casting Time: 1 minute<br>
Range: 60 feetv
Components: V<br>
Duration: 30 days<br>
Replaces: Geas<br>

You magically bind a creature that can understand you within
range to either complete or abstain from some action or
activity. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or
become charmed by you for the duration. Once per turn while
charmed in this way, the target's current and maximum hit
points are reduced by 5d10 if its behavior contradicts your
instructions. This reduction lasts until the spell ends.
You can issue any command you choose, though the spell
ends if you issue a suicidal command. The creature's death
does not end the spell.

As an action, you can end the spell early. Remove curse
cast at the spell's level also ends the spell. Greater restoration
ends the reduction of the target's hit point maximum, but it
does not end the spell.

At Higher Levels. The spell reduces maximum hit points
by an additional 1d10 for each slot level above 5th. When you
cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th or 8th level, the
duration is 1 year. When you cast this spell using a spell slot
of 9th level, the spell lasts until it is ended by one of the spells
mentioned above.

## HOLD MONSTER*
5th-­level enchantment<br>
Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: 90 ft.<br>
Components: V, S, M (a small, straight piece of iron)<br>
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute<br>

Choose a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be paralyzed for the duration. This spell has no effect on undead. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 6th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each level above 5th. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

## INSECT PLAGUE
5th-­level conjuration<br>
Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: 300 ft.<br>
Components: V, S, M<br>
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes<br>

Swarming, biting locusts fill a 20-foot-­radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere spreads around corners. The sphere remains for the duration, and its area is lightly obscured. The sphere’s area is difficult terrain.

When the locusts appears, each creature within the area of the sphere must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 4d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each level above 5th.

## MASS CURE WOUNDS*
5th-­level evocation<br>
Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: 60 ft.<br>
Components: V, S<br>
Duration: Instantaneous<br>

A wave of healing energy washes out from a point of your choice within range. Choose up to six creatures in a 30-foot-­radius sphere centered on that point. Each target regains hit points equal to 3d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on constructs.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 6th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each level above 5th.

## MODIFY MEMORY*
5th-­level enchantment<br>
Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: 30 ft.<br>
Components: V, S<br>
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute<br>

You attempt to reshape another creature’s memories. One creature that you can see must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes charmed by you for the duration. The charmed target is incapacitated and unaware of its surroundings, though it can still hear you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends, and none of the target’s memories are modified.

While this charm lasts, you can affect the target’s memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event.

You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you have finished describing the modified memories, the creature’s memory isn’t altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.

A modified memory doesn’t necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature’s natural inclinations or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The GM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant manner.

A remove curse or greater restoration spell cast on the target restores the creature’s true memory.

At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell at 6th level or higher, you can alter the target’s memories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago (6th level), 30 days ago (7th level), 1 year ago (8th level), or any time in the creature’s past (9th level).

## PLANAR BINDING*
5th-­level abjuration<br>
Casting Time: 1 hour<br>
Range: 60 ft.<br>
Components: V, S, M (a jewel worth at least 1,000 thaler, which the spell consumes)<br>
Duration: 24 hours<br>

With this spell, you attempt to bind a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend to your service. The creature must be within range for the entire casting of the spell. (Typically, the creature is first summoned into the center of an inverted magic circle in order to keep it trapped while this spell is cast.) At the completion of the casting, the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it is bound to serve you for the duration. If the creature was summoned or created by another spell, that spell’s duration is extended to match the duration of this spell.

A bound creature must follow your instructions to the best of its ability. You might command the creature to accompany you on an adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. The creature obeys the letter of your instructions, but if the creature is hostile to you, it strives to twist your words to achieve its own objectives. If the creature carries out your instructions completely before the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you are on the same plane of existence. If you are on a different plane of existence, it returns to the place where you bound it and remains there until the spell ends.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at a higher level, the duration increases to 10 days at 6th level, to 30 days at 7th- level, to 180 days at 8th level, and to a year and a day at 9th level.

## PURGATORY
5th-­level evocation (ritual)<br>
Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: 30 ft.<br>
Components: V, S, M (short piece of rusty chain)<br>
Duration: Instantaneous<br>

You choose a creature within range, it must make a Wisdom saving throw with its current total Corruption as the DC. For thoroughly corrupt creatures the DC is 30. On a failure, the target takes 8d6 radiant damage or half that amount on a success.

At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell at 6th level or higher, you can target an additional creature for each level above 5th.

## Regenerate*
5th-level transmutation (ritual)<br>
Casting Time: 1 minute<br>
Range: touch<br>
Components: V, S, M (a prayer wheel, holy water, and healing potions worth at least 500 gold, which the spell consumes)<br>
Duration: 1 hour<br>

You touch a creature and stimulate its natural healing ability. The target regains 4d8 + 15 vigour points. For the duration of the spell, the target regains 1 vigor point at the start of each of its turns (10 vigor points each minute).

The target’s severed body members (fingers, legs, tails, and so on), if any, are restored after 1 hour. If you have the severed part and hold it to the stump, the spell instantaneously causes the limb to knit to the stump. This spell does not heal any injury or scar that is older than one week.

This spell replaces the 7th level version.

## TURN WEATHER
5th-­level transmutation<br>
Casting Time: 10 minutes<br>
Range: Self<br>
Components: V, S<br>
Duration: Concentration, up to 8 <br>

You influence the weather within 5 miles of you for the duration. You must be outdoors to cast this spell. Moving to a place where you don’t have a clear path to the sky ends the spell early.

When you cast the spell, you change one of the current weather conditions, which are determined by the GM based on climate and season. You can change one of the following: precipitation, temperature, or wind. It takes 1d4 × 10 minutes for the new condition to take effect. Once it does so, you can change one of the conditions (the same or another) again. When the spell ends, the weather gradually returns to normal.

When you change a weather condition, find the current condition on the following tables and change its stage by one, up or down. When changing the winds, you can change its direction by one step (for example, from north to north-­east or from south-­west to south, etc.).


|   | Precipation |
|---|---|
|Stage|Condition|
|1|Clear|
|2|Light clouds|
|3|Overcast or ground fog|
|4|Rain, hail, or snow|
|5|Torrential rain, driving hail, or blizzard|
