# 6th Level Spells

## ATONEMENT

6th-­level transmutation ritual

Casting Time: 1 minute

Range: Touch

Components: V

Duration: Special

You are able to lighten the spiritual burdens of a non-­possessed, willing person; this is done by the sinner accepting to perform a task for the theurg on behalf of the Church. The task must be time-­consuming, expensive, or dangerous (or perhaps a combination of these factors). Upon completion of the task, the target’s permanent Corruption is reduced by 1d3 + 1.

If the target goes a month or more without making effort towards the task, the spell ends and the target gains one point of permanent Corruption for failing Prios.

## CREATE UNDEAD*

6th-­level necromancy

Casting Time: 1 minute

Range: 10 ft.

Components: V, S, M (one clay pot filled with grave dirt, one clay pot filled with brackish water, and one 75 thaler black onyx stone for each corpse)

Duration: Instantaneous

Create Undead

You can cast this spell only at night. Choose up to three corpses of Medium or Small humanoids within range. Each corpse becomes a dragoul under your control. (The GM has game statistics for these creatures.)

As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can mentally command any creature you animated with this spell if the creature is within 120 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.

The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you have given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to three creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating new ones.

## LIVING FORTRESS

6th-­level transmutation (ritual)

Casting Time: 1 hour

Range: 10 ft.

Components: V, S

Duration: Special

Living Fortress

You create a fortress of living trees and thorny bushes that erupt from the local growth. The fortress is approximately 20 feet on a side and no higher than 20 feet. Its exact layout is determined by the caster. Each wall and the canopy roof have 50 hit points, AC 15, resistance to non-­magical piercing damage and immunity to poison and psychic damage. At the start of a round, a damaged section regenerates 5 hit points of damage.

You can allow creatures of your choice to enter or exit the fortress and teach them special words to allow them passage even if you’re not there. Inside the fortress it is always dry and a comfortable temperature. Other creatures who attempt to enter (or leave) the fortress must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d12 piercing damage on a failure or half that on a success.

The fortress lives a season (three months) and then the spell must be cast again or the magic will fade and it will start to wither away.

## PATRON SAINT*

6th-­level conjuration

Casting Time: 10 minutes

Range: 120 ft.

Components: V, S (a bit of fleece and jade dust worth at least 25 thaler)

Duration: Special

You summon a guardian spirit to aid you, the soul of a fallen Templar that has been given the honorable mission to once again serve one of the Sun God’s chosen. The martyr manifests as a being of light. It is normally invisible, but begins to shine when danger is close.

In non-­combat situations, the spirit serves as your assistant. Once on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command. The spirit will never venture more than 120 feet away from you. If it is somehow prevented from remaining within that distance of you, it is dispelled when the distance between the two of you exceeds the range of the spell.

In combat, the spirit becomes a glowing figure with a flail made out of light and a halo above its head. Use the following statblock for the spirit, it acts independently. If slain, the spirit is dispelled. The spirit counts as a member of your group, receiving a full share of experience points awarded.

## SOUL STONE

6th-­level necromancy (ritual)

Casting Time: 10 minutes

Range: Touch

Components: S, M (special)

Duration: Special

During desperate moments of the war, the battle mages of Ordo Magica took increasingly greater risks in the name of necessity and thereby brought Corruption upon themselves. To counteract this evil they dusted off an ancient and shunned ritual, by which one can capture the soul of a dying creature in a crystal prepared for the purpose. That same ritual proved to work well in order to drain Corruption from a wizard and transfer it to the soul in the stone.

With the first casting, the mystic uses a soul stone (see {Soul Stone.}) worth at least 100 thaler and a creature that dies as a result of the spell. The creature must have less than 10 hit points at the time you begin to cast the spell. At the end of the spell, the creature dies, and the spell collects the soul of the dying creature, turning the gem into a soul stone. Roll 2d4 and add your spellcasting modifier; this is the amount of permanent Corruption that the soul stone can hold.

Subsequent castings allow the mystic to move 1d4 points of permanent Corruption to the soul stone. The soul stone darkens as it fills up and detonates if its limit is surpassed. The collected Corruption then rushes back to the mystic, often with a rather nasty result.

You can only use a single soul stone at a time and cannot create a new one while an old one exists.

## SOUL CAGE

6th-­level necromancy (ritual)

Casting Time:

1 Reaction  which you take when a humanoid you can see within 60 feet of you dies

Range: 60 ft

Components: V, S, M a tiny silver cage worth 100 gp

Duration: Special

This spell snatches the soul of a humanoid as it dies and traps it inside the tiny cage you use for the material component. A stolen soul remains inside the cage until the spell ends or until you destroy the cage, which ends the spell. While you have a soul inside the cage, you can exploit it in any of the ways described below. You can use a trapped soul up to six times. Once you exploit a soul for the sixth time, it is released, and the spell ends. While a soul is trapped, the dead humanoid it came from can’t be revived.

Steal Life. You can use a bonus action to drain vigor from the soul and regain 2d8 hit points.

Query Soul. You ask the soul a question (no action required) and receive a brief telepathic answer, which you can understand regardless of the language used. The soul knows only what it knew in life, but it must answer you truthfully and to the best of its ability. The answer is no more than a sentence or two and might be cryptic.

Borrow Experience. You can use a bonus action to bolster yourself with the soul’s life experience, making your next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw with advantage. If you don’t use this benefit before the start of your next turn, it is lost.

Eyes of the Dead. You can use an action to name a place the humanoid saw in life, which creates an invisible sensor somewhere in that place if it is on the plane of existence you’re currently on. The sensor remains for as long as you concentrate, up to 10 minutes (as if you were concentrating on a spell). You receive visual and auditory information from the sensor as if you were in its space using your senses.

A creature that can see the sensor (such as one using [see invisibility](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/see-invisibility) or [truesight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Truesight)) sees a translucent image of the tormented humanoid whose soul you caged.

## SUNBEAM

6th-­level Evocation (ritual)

Casting Time: 1 Action 

Range: Self (60 ft Line)

Components: V, S, M

Duration: Concentration 1 Minute

A beam of brilliant light flashes out from your hand in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long line. Each creature in the line must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 radiant damage and is [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Blinded) until your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Blinded) by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.

You can create a new line of radiance as your action on any turn until the spell ends.

For the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines in your hand. It sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This light is sunlight.
