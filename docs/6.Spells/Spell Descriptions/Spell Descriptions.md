A DETAILED LISTING of new and modified spells follows. Spells are divided by level and then presented in alphabetical order.

Important Notes

A Spell By Any Other Name

The names of some OGL spells appear a little different in this listing than other products. In short, we can’t use anyone’s name, so if the spell is named after its famous inventor, the name is left off or changed up. Otherwise, the spells remain the same.

If a spell appears in the core rules without significant changes, it is listed here but not included in the detailed spell list. If a spell that is not included in the detailed list has a material component cost listed in gold pieces (gp) higher than 50 gp, the actual cost is half that value in thaler (e.g. a 100 gp material component costs 50 thaler, a 25 gp component costs 25 thaler).

Spells in semibold italics can be cast as rituals.

Spells with an asterisk (*) cannot be favored.
