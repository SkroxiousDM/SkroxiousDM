A DETAILED LISTING of new and modified spells follows. Spells are divided by level and then presented in alphabetical order.

Important Notes

A Spell By Any Other Name

The names of some OGL spells appear a little different in this listing than other products. In short, we can’t use anyone’s name, so if the spell is named after its famous inventor, the name is left off or changed up. Otherwise, the spells remain the same.

If a spell appears in the core rules without significant changes, it is listed here but not included in the detailed spell list. If a spell that is not included in the detailed list has a material component cost listed in gold pieces (gp) higher than 50 gp, the actual cost is half that value in thaler (e.g. a 100 gp material component costs 50 thaler, a 25 gp component costs 25 thaler).

Spells in semibold italics can be cast as rituals.

Spells with an asterisk (*) cannot be favored.

The target becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or a zombie if you chose a corpse (the GM has the creature’s game statistics).

On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.

The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you’ve given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends.

- Choose one ability score. While cursed, the target has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability score.
- While cursed, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you.
- While cursed, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns. If it fails, it wastes its action that turn doing nothing.
- While the target is cursed, your attacks and spells deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target.

A remove curse spell ends this effect. At the GM’s discretion, you may invent a different curse effect, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The Game­master has final say on such a curse’s effect.

At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell at 4th level, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. If you cast it at 5th level, the duration is 8 hours. If you cast at 7th level, the duration is 24 hours. If you cast at 9th level, the spell lasts until it is dispelled.

If no unoccupied space is available within that range, you appear in the nearest unoccupied space (chosen at random if more than one space is equally near). You can dismiss this spell as an action.

FLY*

3rd-­level transmutation

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Touch

Components: V, S, M (a wing feather from any bird)

Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

@Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-spells.v3TLUwrRIAtjVvOZ]{Fly}

You touch a willing creature. The target gains a flying speed of 60 feet for the duration. When the spell ends, the target falls if it is still aloft, unless it can stop the fall.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each level above 3rd.

GLYPH OF WARDING

3rd-­level abjuration

Casting Time: 1 hour

Range: Touch

Components: V, S, M (incense and powdered diamond worth at least 100 thaler, which the spell consumes)

Duration: Until dispelled or triggered

@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.pB7XVYwdGNcUG935]{Glyph of Warding}

When you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that later unleashes a magical effect. You inscribe it either on a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.

The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.

You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.

You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect only abominations). You can also set conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.

When you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.

- Explosive Runes. When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-­radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.
- Spell Glyph. You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive runes glyph increases by 1d8 for each level above 3rd. If you create a spell glyph, you can store any spell of up to the same level as you use for the glyph of warding.

JUDGING BONDS

3rd-­level enchantment (ritual)

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Touch

Components: V, S

Duration: 1 month

@Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-spells.cuLV3grR5q0yTYZi]{Judging Bonds}

You allow pacifying light to flow through the chains or shackles holding a person. This prevents that person from using mystical powers and provides disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity checks and saving throws while bound.

LARVAE BOIL

3rd-­level conjuration

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Touch

Components: V, S, M (a live wasp)

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

@Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-spells.Z6pmOlroJ6cnkYNf]{Larvae Boil}

Drawing from the force of wrath you can infuse an enemy’s body with larvae that then start to eat their way out. Although it is loudly refuted by members of the court, persistent rumors say that this is how the hero king Ynedar met his demise.

On a successful melee spell attack, the victim is infected with larvae. At the end of its turn, it suffers 1d4 piercing damage. On the next round the damage increases to 1d6 piercing damage, on the third round the damage is 1d8, and on the fourth round it is 1d10 damage, and on the fifth and all following rounds it increases to 1d12 piercing damage.

At Higher Levels. If cast at 4th level, the victim takes 1d6 piercing damage on the first round, which increases each subsequent round, to a total of 1d12 piercing damage per round. At 5th level, the damage starts off at 1d8 on the first round, then at 6th level it starts at 1d10 piercing damage, and at 7th level it starts at 1d12 piercing damage.

LIGHTNING BOLT*

3rd-­level evocation

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Self

Components: V, S, M (a bit of fur and a rod of amber, crystal, or glass)

Duration: Instantaneous

@Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-spells.8hKOmdNlW01cSUuX]{Lightning Bolt}

A stroke of lightning forming a line 100 feet long and 5 feet wide blasts out from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The lightning ignites flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each level above 3rd.

MAGIC CIRCLE

3rd-­level abjuration

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 10 feet

Components: V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron worth at least 50 thaler, which the spell consumes)

Duration: 1 hour

@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.y8A4HfTwd93ypdEz]{Magic Circle}

You create a 10-foot-­radius, 20-foot-­tall cylinder of magical energy centered on a point on the ground that you can see within range. Glowing runes appear wherever the cylinder intersects with the floor or another surface. Choose one option: a) A mystic that knows the pattern to a permanent teleportation circle may communicate telepathically with the attendant of that circle (see The Chapter Circles of Ordo Magica below). Or b) Choose one or more of the following types of creatures: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or phenomenons. The circle affects a creature of the chosen type in the following ways:

- The creature can’t willingly enter the cylinder by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw.
- The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets within the cylinder.
- Targets within the cylinder can’t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by the creature.

When you choose this option, you can elect to cause its magic to operate in the reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the cylinder and protecting targets outside it.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 4th level or higher, the duration increases by 1 hour for each level above 3rd.

The Chapter Circles of Ordo Magica

Each chapter of Ordo Magica has a permanent teleportation circle and these are more or less always manned by a bored and/or studying novice, making it possible to always reach the chapter telepathically.

Telepathy is the transmission of direct thought, with no opportunity for subtlety or dissembling, so wizards are generally reluctant to overuse telepathic communication, especially with mystics they do not know very well. Even with trusted colleagues, transmissions are kept as short as possible – on the crowded career ladder of Ordo Magica there is no room to give even a close friend any competitive advantage, if you can avoid it.

MAJOR IMAGE

3rd-­level illusion

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 120 feet

Components: V, S, M (a bit of fleece)

Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.nslx2nT3p4lNkmdp]{Major Image}

You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can’t create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte’s stench).

As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 6th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring your concentration.

MASS HEALING WORD*

3rd-­level evocation

Casting Time: 1 bonus action

Range: 60 feet

Components: V

Duration: Instantaneous

@Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-spells.c2hB2wF0rLvsF0MP]{Mass Healing Word}

As you call out words of restoration, up to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range regain hit points equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on constructs.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 4th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d4 for each level above 3rd.

PURGING FIRE

3rd-­level evocation (ritual)

Casting Time: 8 hours

Range: Self

Components: V, S, M (holy incense, 50 thaler worth)

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

@Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-spells.lguKefLuxYeAfzEj]{Purging Fire}

You prepare yourself with songs and prayers before climbing onto a burning pyre to cleanse your body of Corruption. Each round you remain in the fire you take 1d12 fire damage. If you do not lose concentration on the spell, you reduce your permanent Corruption by 1 point. You must take damage in order to reduce your Corruption. Thus you can remove up to 10 points of permanent Corruption if you remain in the pyre for the duration.

You cannot cast this spell for anyone else, only you may benefit from it.

SPIRIT GUARDIANS*

3rd-­level conjuration

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Self

Components: V, S, M (a holy symbol)

Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

@Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-spells.QMSDFoovgiuS9Fta]{Spirit Guardians}

You call forth spirits to protect you. They flit around you to a distance of 15 feet for the duration. If you are blight-­stricken or uncorrupted, their spectral form appears angelic or fey (your choice). If you are blight-­marked, they appear fiendish.

When you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. An affected creature’s speed is halved in the area, and when the creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 radiant damage or 3d8 necrotic damage (if you are blight-­marked). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each level above 3rd.

SUMMON DAEMON

3rd-­level conjuration (ritual)

Casting Time: 10 minutes

Range: Self

Components: V, S, M (candles, dagger and golden bowl)

Duration: Special

@Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-spells.L5BsvIjJ0mTN5i4r]{Summon Daemon}

You summon an abomination from the Yonderworld, a daemon. The creature resists your control and you must make a contested Charisma check to keep it under your control. If you fail and the daemon was not summoned into an inverted magic circle, the daemon is free to do as it likes (including attacking you or your allies) and is free to roam until it chooses to return to the Yonderworld (which it can do as an action) or it is destroyed. If it is trapped in an inverted magic circle it instead cannot move and returns to the Yonderworld at the end of the magic circle’s duration. You can talk to the daemon during this time, but it is under no compulsion to speak or to give you truthful answers.

If you succeed at the Charisma check then the daemon is under your control for 24 hours. If requested, it will return to the Yonderworld, which ends your control of it. It will also carry out your orders, unless they involve a clear danger to the daemon from the servants of Prios or another god. It takes its own turn and follows your commands.

When you cast this spell, you summon a Servant Daemon. If you choose to gain a point of permanent Corruption you can instead summon a Vindictive Daemon, for two points of permanent Corruption you can summon a Knowledge Daemon or for three points of permanent Corruption you can summon a Guardian Daemon. The stats for the daemons are included below.

VAMPIRIC TOUCH*

3rd-­level necromancy

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Self

Components: V, S

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

@Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-spells.zOeUIVRdaQ8unYRf]{Vampiric Touch}

Just a touch from your shadow-­wreathed hand can siphon the life force from others to heal your wounds. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 necrotic damage, and you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt (rounded down). Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of your turns as an action.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each level above 3rd.

4th Level Spells

BANISHMENT*

4th-­level abjuration

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 60 ft.

Components: V, S, M (an item distasteful to the target)

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

@Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-spells.DQoPqmbuxhVTH8kI]{Banishment}

You attempt to send one creature that you can see within range to another plane of existence. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished.

If the target is native to the plane of existence you’re on, you banish the target to a harmless demiplane. While there, the target is incapacitated. The target remains there until the spell ends, at which point the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

If the target is native to a different plane of existence (such as a fiend) than the one you’re on, the target is banished with a faint popping noise, returning to its home plane. If the spell ends before 1 minute has passed, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. Otherwise, the target doesn’t return.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each level above 4th.

BLIGHT*

4th-­level necromancy

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 30 ft.

Components: V, S

Duration: Instantaneous

@Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-spells.OZu3aCWCW1PJaGro]{Blight}

Necromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can see within range, draining moisture and vitality from it. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. The target takes 8d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

If you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it.

If you target a nonmagical plant that isn’t a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it doesn’t make a saving throw; it simply withers and dies.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each level above 4th.

CONFUSION*

4th-­level enchantment

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 90 ft.

Components: V, S, M (three nut shells)

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

@Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-spells.EoSXQXMJomefvWtp]{Confusion}

This spell assaults and twists creatures’ minds, spawning delusions and provoking uncontrolled action. Each creature in a 10-foot-­radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.

An affected target can’t take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.

At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 5th level or higher, the radius of the sphere increases by 5 feet for each level above 4th.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|1d10|Behavior|
|1|The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) to each die face. The creature doesn’t take an action this turn.|
|2–6|The creature doesn’t move or take actions this turn.|
|7–8|The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn.|
|9–10|The creature can act and move normally.|

DOMINATE BEAST

4th-­level enchantment

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 60 ft.

Components: V, S

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.LrPvWHBPmiMQQsKB]{Dominate Beast}

You attempt to beguile a beast that you can see within range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.

While the beast is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as “Attack that creature,” “Run over there,” or “Fetch that object.” If the creature completes the order and doesn’t receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.

You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn’t do anything that you don’t allow it to do. During this time, you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.

Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 5th-­level, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. When you cast at 6th-­level, the duration is concentration, up to 1 hour. When you cast at 7th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours.

ICE STORM

4th-­level evocation

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 300 ft.

Components: V, S, M (a pinch of dust and a few drops of water)

Duration: Instantaneous

@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.WN2LWEljYU6QqnRH]{Ice Storm}

A hail of rock-­hard ice pounds to the ground in a 20-foot-­radius, 40-foot-­high cylinder centered on a point within range. Each creature in the cylinder must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 4d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Hailstones turn the storm’s area of effect into difficult terrain until the end of your next turn.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 5th level or higher, the bludgeoning damage increases by 1d8 for each level above 4th.

ILLUSORY CORRECTION

4th-­level illusion

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 60 ft.

Components: V

Duration: Special

@Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-spells.S2ubFomMftEEIOV0]{Illusory Correction}

There are gaps between reality and our perception of it. By casting this spell, the mystic takes advantage of these discrepancies. While this spell is active, when you or another creature within range makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw you can use your reaction to make a correction of reality, either forcing another creature to reroll the d20 or allowing yourself to do so.

At the end of your turn if you have used your reaction since your previous turn, you must make a spellcasting ability check to keep track of the differences between your personal reality and that which others perceive. The DC starts at 5 and increases each time by 5. If you fail the check the spell immediately ends (you cannot use your reaction to reroll).

LIFEGIVER

4th-­level evocation (ritual)

Casting Time: 1 hour

Range: Touch

Components: V, S

Duration: Instantaneous

@Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-spells.KtRm24qtYJ1QExbv]{Lifegiver}

As you cast this spell, you touch a number of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus. You can be one of those creatures. Each creature’s temporary Corruption is reduced by 1d4. Any excess points restore the creature’s hit points.

At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell at 5th level or higher, you can heal one additional creature per spell level.

PHANTASMAL KILLER*

4th-­level illusion

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 120 ft.

Components: V, S

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

@Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-spells.6rDFckaCEpaqff8a]{Phantasmal Killer}

You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can see within range and create an illusory manifestation of its deepest fears, visible only to that creature. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes frightened for the duration. At the end of each of the target’s turns before the spell ends, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each level above 4th.

PRIVATE SANCTUM

4th-­level abjuration

Casting Time: 10 minutes

Range: 120 ft.

Components: V, S, M (a thin sheet of lead, a piece of opaque glass, a wad of cotton or cloth, and powdered chrysolite)

Duration: 24 hours

@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.NJgxf7pmSsBArIG7]{Private Sanctum}

You make an area within range magically secure. The area is a cube that can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The spell lasts for the duration or until you use an action to dismiss it.

When you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell provides, choosing any or all of the following properties:

- Sound can’t pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded area.
- The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing vision (including darkvision) through it.
- Sensors created by divination spells can’t appear inside the protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter.
- Creatures in the area can’t be targeted by divination spells.
- Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area.
- Planar travel is blocked within the warded area.

Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 5th level or higher, you can increase the size of the cube by 100 feet for each level beyond 4th. Thus you could protect a cube that can be up to 200 feet on one side by casting this spell at 5th level.

WALL OF FIRE

4th-­level evocation

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 120 ft.

Components: V, S, M (a small piece of phosphorus)

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.X3DrXgxjwI2dvkD6]{Wall of Fire}

You create a wall of fire on a solid surface within range. You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is opaque and lasts for the duration.

When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.

Either the inside or outside of the wall, selected by you when you cast this spell, deals 5d8 fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of the selected side. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each level above 4th.

5th Level Spells

ANIMATE OBJECTS

5th-­level transmutation

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 120 ft.

Components: V, S

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.ATo0Eb63TDtnu6iA]{Animate Objects}

Objects come to life at your command. Choose up to ten nonmagical objects within range that are not being worn or carried. Medium targets count as two objects, Large targets count as four objects, Huge targets count as eight objects. You can’t animate any object larger than Huge. Each target animates and becomes a creature under your control until the spell ends or until reduced to 0 hit points.

As a bonus action, you can mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.

An animated object is a construct with AC, hit points, attacks, Strength, and Dexterity determined by its size. Its Constitution is 10 and its Intelligence and Wisdom are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its speed is 30 feet; if the object lacks legs or other appendages it can use for locomotion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. If the object is securely attached to a surface or a larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0. It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond that distance. When the animated object drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original object form, and any remaining damage carries over to its original object form.

When you command an object to attack, it can make a single melee attack during your turn against a creature within 5 feet of it. It makes a slam attack with an attack bonus and bludgeoning damage determined by its size. The GM might rule that a specific object inflicts slashing or piercing damage based on its form.

At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell at 6th level or higher, you can animate two additional objects for each level above 5th.

|   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Size|HP|AC|Str|Dex|Attack|
|Tiny|20|18|4 (−3)|18 (+4)|+8 to hit, 6 (1d4 + 4) damage|
|Small|25|16|6 (−2)|14 (+2)|+6 to hit, 6 (1d8 + 2) damage|
|Medium|40|13|10 (+0)|12 (+1)|+5 to hit, 8 (2d6 + 1) damage|
|Large|50|10|14 (+2)|10 (+0)|+6 to hit, 13 (2d10 + 2) damage|
|Huge|80|10|18 (+4)|6 (−2)|+8 to hit, 17 (2d12 + 4) damage|

ARCANE HAND

5th-­level evocation

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 120 ft.

Components: V, S, M (an eggshell and a snakeskin glove)

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.a2KJHCIbY5Mi4Dmn]{Arcane Hand}

You create a Large hand of shimmering, translucent force in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The hand lasts for the spell’s duration, and it moves at your command, mimicking the movements of your own hand.

The hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit point maximum. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. It has a Strength of 26 (+8) and a Dexterity of 10 (+0). The hand doesn’t fill its space. When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following effects with it:

- Clenched Fist. The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand using your game statistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage.
- Forceful Hand. The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose. Make a check with the hand’s Strength contested by the Strength (Athletics) check of the target. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it.
- Grasping Hand. The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand’s Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. While the hand is grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to have the hand crush it. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier.
- Interposing Hand. The hand interposes itself between you and a creature you choose until you give the hand a different command. The hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half cover against the target. The target can’t move through the hand’s space if its Strength score is less than or equal to the hand’s Strength score. If its Strength score is higher than the hand’s Strength score, the target can move toward you through the hand’s space, but that space counts as difficult terrain for the target.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 6th level or higher, the damage from the clenched fist option increases by 2d8, the damage from the grasping hand increases by 2d6, the Strength for the forceful hand increases by 2 for each level above 5th.

CLOUDKILL

5th-­level conjuration

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 120 ft.

Components: V, S

Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.LkvI11Uue774QBKZ]{Cloudkill}

You create a 20-foot-­radius sphere of poisonous, yellow-­green fog centered on a point you choose within range. The fog spreads around corners. It lasts for the duration or until a strong wind disperses the fog, ending the spell. Its area is heavily obscured.

When a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 5d8 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don’t need to breathe.

The fog moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns, rolling along the surface of the ground. The vapors, being heavier than air, sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down openings.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each level above 5th.

COMMUNE WITH SPIRITS*

5th-­level divination (ritual)

Casting Time: 10 minutes

Range: Self

Components: V, S

Duration: Special

@Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-spells.tl6VfSMKaVsxnn8j]{Commune with Spirits}

The world is old and many spirits linger from days past; nature spirits in dirt and water, or dead heroes who have not yet passed over to the other side. You contact these spirits and ask for their help. This help takes one of the following three forms:

- You can ask the spirits what important thing occurred here in the past. Note that spirits have a very limited understanding of time, so a battle that occurred 500 years ago might be more interesting to them than the murder that happened yesterday.
- You can ask them three yes or no questions that they will try to answer as accurately as possible. However, they are limited by their knowledge and won’t do well with questions outside their own experiences.
- You can name or describe an enemy. For the next 24 hours if that enemy approaches within 30 feet of your current location the spirits will attack them. At the start of its turn each specified creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure they become frightened of the area and take 1d6 psychic damage. On a success they are not frightened but still take 1d6 psychic damage.

CONE OF COLD

5th-­level evocation

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Self

Components: V, S, M (a small crystal or glass cone)

Duration: Instantaneous

@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.RpKjTlYASrfqUPVA]{Cone of Cold}

A blast of cold air erupts from your hands. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 8d8 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

A creature killed by this spell becomes a frozen statue until it thaws.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each level above 5th.

CREATION

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Material|Duration|
|Vegetable matter|1 day|
|Stone or crystal|12 hours|
|Precious metals|1 hour|
|Gems|10 minutes|
|Adamantine or mithral|1 minute|

5th-­level illusion

Casting Time: 1 minute

Range: 30 ft.

Components: V, S, M (a tiny piece of matter of the same type as the item you plan to create)

Duration: Special

@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.lnaGnxMzpYnbw1uU]{Creation}

You pull wisps of shadow material from the surroundings to create a nonliving object of vegetable matter within range: soft goods, rope, wood, or something similar. You can also use this spell to create mineral objects such as stone, crystal, or metal. The object created must be no larger than a 5-foot cube, and the object must be of a form and material that you have seen before.

The duration depends on the object’s material. If the object is composed of multiple materials, use the shortest duration. Using any material created by this spell as another spell’s material component causes that spell to fail.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 6th level or higher, the cube increases by 5 feet for each level above 5th.

DISPEL EVIL AND GOOD*

5th-­level abjuration

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 120 ft.

Components: V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron)

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

@Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-spells.o0ROO26mNKevlhXc]{Dispel Evil and Good}

Shimmering energy surrounds and protects you from abominations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or phenomenons, providing disadvantage on their attack rolls against you.

You can end the spell early by using the following special function:

- Break Enchantment. As your action, you touch a creature you can reach that is charmed, frightened, or possessed by an abomination, a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend. The creature you touch is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed by such creatures.

DOMINATE PERSON*

5th-­level enchantment

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 60 ft.

Components: V, S

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

@Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-spells.1kT0DjUzkv3MUXjJ]{Dominate Person}

You attempt to beguile a humanoid that you can see within range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.

While the target is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as “Attack that creature,” “Run over there,” or “Fetch that object.” If the creature completes the order and doesn’t receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.

You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn’t do anything that you don’t allow it to do. During this time you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.

Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 6th-­level, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. When you cast at 7th-­level, the duration is concentration, up to 1 hour. When you cast the spell at 8th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours.

EXORCISM

5th-­level transmutation, ritual

Casting Time: 1 hour

Range: 30 feet

Components: V, S, M (sprinkler of holy water)

Duration: Instantaneous

@Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-spells.RNOpk0FGq5qIu7kw]{Exorcism}

You call out to Prios to purge the immediate area of any creature that is not native to the material world and anoint everything else with his holy water. At the end of the casting time, each extraplanar creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you can see the creature as you cast the spell (for example it is trapped within a magic circle or otherwise confined) then it has disadvantage on its saving throw. An exorcised creature cannot return to the material world until at least 24 hours have passed.

FIRE SOUL

5th-­level transmutation, ritual

Casting Time: 10 minutes

Range: Self

Components: V, S, M (pinch of ash)

Duration: 1 hour

@Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-spells.jyRdZpt3bgT0nNZE]{Fire Soul}

Your eyes glow with a red light and you become extraordinarily hot to the touch. Creatures that touch you or attack you from within five feet take 6 (1d12) fire damage. You are immune to fire damage and the first time you take fire damage you instead regain hit points equal to half the damage you would have taken, rounded down.

FLAME STRIKE*

5th-­level evocation

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 60 ft.

Components: V, S, M (pinch of sulfur)

Duration: Instantaneous

@Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-spells.GYjF1BofAD66I1C4]{Flame Strike}

A vertical column of divine fire roars down from the heavens in a location you specify. Each creature in a 10-foot-­radius, 40-foot-­high cylinder centered on a point within range must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d6 fire damage and 4d6 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 6th level or higher, the fire damage or the radiant damage (your choice) increases by 1d6 for each level above 5th.

GEAS*

5th-­level enchantment

Casting Time: 1 minute

Range: 60 ft.

Components: V

Duration: 30 days

@Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-spells.XmmRdDTtx84xMbz1]{Geas}

You place a magical command on a creature that you can see within range, forcing it to carry out some service or refrain from some action or activity as you decide. If the creature can understand you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While the creature is charmed by you, it takes 5d10 psychic damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions, but no more than once each day. A creature that can’t understand you is unaffected by the spell.

You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell ends.

You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. A remove curse, greater restoration, or wish spell also ends it.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 7th or 8th level, the duration is 1 year. When you cast this spell at 9th level, the spell lasts until it is ended by one of the spells mentioned above.

HOLD MONSTER*

5th-­level enchantment

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 90 ft.

Components: V, S, M (a small, straight piece of iron)

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

@Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-spells.xWq7Z65J0VzjaC7b]{Hold Monster}

Choose a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be paralyzed for the duration. This spell has no effect on undead. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 6th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each level above 5th. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

INSECT PLAGUE

5th-­level conjuration

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 300 ft.

Components: V, S, M

Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.OVikYmSdHliAG2YD]{Insect Plague}

Swarming, biting locusts fill a 20-foot-­radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere spreads around corners. The sphere remains for the duration, and its area is lightly obscured. The sphere’s area is difficult terrain.

When the locusts appears, each creature within the area of the sphere must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 4d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each level above 5th.

MASS CURE WOUNDS*

5th-­level evocation

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 60 ft.

Components: V, S

Duration: Instantaneous

@Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-spells.HWdt3RD6XdvlQZrB]{Mass Cure Wounds}

A wave of healing energy washes out from a point of your choice within range. Choose up to six creatures in a 30-foot-­radius sphere centered on that point. Each target regains hit points equal to 3d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on constructs.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at 6th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each level above 5th.

MODIFY MEMORY*

5th-­level enchantment

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 30 ft.

Components: V, S

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

@Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-spells.qMrLAdTlRCPnJRzi]{Modify Memory}

You attempt to reshape another creature’s memories. One creature that you can see must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes charmed by you for the duration. The charmed target is incapacitated and unaware of its surroundings, though it can still hear you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends, and none of the target’s memories are modified.

While this charm lasts, you can affect the target’s memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event.

You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you have finished describing the modified memories, the creature’s memory isn’t altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.

A modified memory doesn’t necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature’s natural inclinations or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The GM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant manner.

A remove curse or greater restoration spell cast on the target restores the creature’s true memory.

At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell at 6th level or higher, you can alter the target’s memories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago (6th level), 30 days ago (7th level), 1 year ago (8th level), or any time in the creature’s past (9th level).

PLANAR BINDING*

5th-­level abjuration

Casting Time: 1 hour

Range: 60 ft.

Components: V, S, M (a jewel worth at least 1,000 thaler, which the spell consumes)

Duration: 24 hours

@Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-spells.enO3LuTeWLvuB4DT]{Planar Binding}

With this spell, you attempt to bind a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend to your service. The creature must be within range for the entire casting of the spell. (Typically, the creature is first summoned into the center of an inverted magic circle in order to keep it trapped while this spell is cast.) At the completion of the casting, the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it is bound to serve you for the duration. If the creature was summoned or created by another spell, that spell’s duration is extended to match the duration of this spell.

A bound creature must follow your instructions to the best of its ability. You might command the creature to accompany you on an adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. The creature obeys the letter of your instructions, but if the creature is hostile to you, it strives to twist your words to achieve its own objectives. If the creature carries out your instructions completely before the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you are on the same plane of existence. If you are on a different plane of existence, it returns to the place where you bound it and remains there until the spell ends.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell at a higher level, the duration increases to 10 days at 6th level, to 30 days at 7th- level, to 180 days at 8th level, and to a year and a day at 9th level.

PURGATORY

5th-­level evocation (ritual)

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 30 ft.

Components: V, S, M (short piece of rusty chain)

Duration: Instantaneous

@Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-spells.6qmTdeP2bvQY741f]{Purgatory}

You choose a creature within range, it must make a Wisdom saving throw with its current total Corruption as the DC. For thoroughly corrupt creatures the DC is 30. On a failure, the target takes 8d6 radiant damage or half that amount on a success.

At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell at 6th level or higher, you can target an additional creature for each level above 5th.

# Regenerate*

5th-level transmutation (ritual)

Casting Time: 1 minute

Range: touch

Components: V, S, M (a prayer wheel, holy water, and healing potions worth at least 500 gold, which the spell consumes)

Duration: 1 hour

You touch a creature and stimulate its natural healing ability. The target regains 4d8 + 15 vigour points. For the duration of the spell, the target regains 1 vigor point at the start of each of its turns (10 vigor points each minute).

The target’s severed body members (fingers, legs, tails, and so on), if any, are restored after 1 hour. If you have the severed part and hold it to the stump, the spell instantaneously causes the limb to knit to the stump. This spell does not heal any injury or scar that is older than one week.

This spell replaces the 7th level version.

TURN WEATHER

5th-­level transmutation

Casting Time: 10 minutes

Range: Self

Components: V, S

Duration: Concentration, up to 8 

@Compendium[symbaroum5eplayersguide.ros-pg-spells.AwM9h3nXRagiQmOC]{Turn Weather}

You influence the weather within 5 miles of you for the duration. You must be outdoors to cast this spell. Moving to a place where you don’t have a clear path to the sky ends the spell early.

When you cast the spell, you change one of the current weather conditions, which are determined by the GM based on climate and season. You can change one of the following: precipitation, temperature, or wind. It takes 1d4 × 10 minutes for the new condition to take effect. Once it does so, you can change one of the conditions (the same or another) again. When the spell ends, the weather gradually returns to normal.

When you change a weather condition, find the current condition on the following tables and change its stage by one, up or down. When changing the winds, you can change its direction by one step (for example, from north to north-­east or from south-­west to south, etc.).

6th Level Spells

ATONEMENT

6th-­level transmutation ritual

Casting Time: 1 minute

Range: Touch

Components: V

Duration: Special

You are able to lighten the spiritual burdens of a non-­possessed, willing person; this is done by the sinner accepting to perform a task for the theurg on behalf of the Church. The task must be time-­consuming, expensive, or dangerous (or perhaps a combination of these factors). Upon completion of the task, the target’s permanent Corruption is reduced by 1d3 + 1.

If the target goes a month or more without making effort towards the task, the spell ends and the target gains one point of permanent Corruption for failing Prios.

CREATE UNDEAD*

6th-­level necromancy

Casting Time: 1 minute

Range: 10 ft.

Components: V, S, M (one clay pot filled with grave dirt, one clay pot filled with brackish water, and one 75 thaler black onyx stone for each corpse)

Duration: Instantaneous

Create Undead

You can cast this spell only at night. Choose up to three corpses of Medium or Small humanoids within range. Each corpse becomes a dragoul under your control. (The GM has game statistics for these creatures.)

As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can mentally command any creature you animated with this spell if the creature is within 120 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.

The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you have given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to three creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating new ones.

LIVING FORTRESS

6th-­level transmutation (ritual)

Casting Time: 1 hour

Range: 10 ft.

Components: V, S

Duration: Special

Living Fortress

You create a fortress of living trees and thorny bushes that erupt from the local growth. The fortress is approximately 20 feet on a side and no higher than 20 feet. Its exact layout is determined by the caster. Each wall and the canopy roof have 50 hit points, AC 15, resistance to non-­magical piercing damage and immunity to poison and psychic damage. At the start of a round, a damaged section regenerates 5 hit points of damage.

You can allow creatures of your choice to enter or exit the fortress and teach them special words to allow them passage even if you’re not there. Inside the fortress it is always dry and a comfortable temperature. Other creatures who attempt to enter (or leave) the fortress must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d12 piercing damage on a failure or half that on a success.

The fortress lives a season (three months) and then the spell must be cast again or the magic will fade and it will start to wither away.

PATRON SAINT*

6th-­level conjuration

Casting Time: 10 minutes

Range: 120 ft.

Components: V, S (a bit of fleece and jade dust worth at least 25 thaler)

Duration: Special

You summon a guardian spirit to aid you, the soul of a fallen Templar that has been given the honorable mission to once again serve one of the Sun God’s chosen. The martyr manifests as a being of light. It is normally invisible, but begins to shine when danger is close.

In non-­combat situations, the spirit serves as your assistant. Once on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command. The spirit will never venture more than 120 feet away from you. If it is somehow prevented from remaining within that distance of you, it is dispelled when the distance between the two of you exceeds the range of the spell.

In combat, the spirit becomes a glowing figure with a flail made out of light and a halo above its head. Use the following statblock for the spirit, it acts independently. If slain, the spirit is dispelled. The spirit counts as a member of your group, receiving a full share of experience points awarded.

SOUL STONE

6th-­level necromancy (ritual)

Casting Time: 10 minutes

Range: Touch

Components: S, M (special)

Duration: Special

During desperate moments of the war, the battle mages of Ordo Magica took increasingly greater risks in the name of necessity and thereby brought Corruption upon themselves. To counteract this evil they dusted off an ancient and shunned ritual, by which one can capture the soul of a dying creature in a crystal prepared for the purpose. That same ritual proved to work well in order to drain Corruption from a wizard and transfer it to the soul in the stone.

With the first casting, the mystic uses a soul stone (see {Soul Stone.}) worth at least 100 thaler and a creature that dies as a result of the spell. The creature must have less than 10 hit points at the time you begin to cast the spell. At the end of the spell, the creature dies, and the spell collects the soul of the dying creature, turning the gem into a soul stone. Roll 2d4 and add your spellcasting modifier; this is the amount of permanent Corruption that the soul stone can hold.

Subsequent castings allow the mystic to move 1d4 points of permanent Corruption to the soul stone. The soul stone darkens as it fills up and detonates if its limit is surpassed. The collected Corruption then rushes back to the mystic, often with a rather nasty result.

You can only use a single soul stone at a time and cannot create a new one while an old one exists.

SOUL CAGE

6th-­level necromancy (ritual)

Casting Time:

1 Reaction  which you take when a humanoid you can see within 60 feet of you dies

Range: 60 ft

Components: V, S, M a tiny silver cage worth 100 gp

Duration: Special

This spell snatches the soul of a humanoid as it dies and traps it inside the tiny cage you use for the material component. A stolen soul remains inside the cage until the spell ends or until you destroy the cage, which ends the spell. While you have a soul inside the cage, you can exploit it in any of the ways described below. You can use a trapped soul up to six times. Once you exploit a soul for the sixth time, it is released, and the spell ends. While a soul is trapped, the dead humanoid it came from can’t be revived.

Steal Life. You can use a bonus action to drain vigor from the soul and regain 2d8 hit points.

Query Soul. You ask the soul a question (no action required) and receive a brief telepathic answer, which you can understand regardless of the language used. The soul knows only what it knew in life, but it must answer you truthfully and to the best of its ability. The answer is no more than a sentence or two and might be cryptic.

Borrow Experience. You can use a bonus action to bolster yourself with the soul’s life experience, making your next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw with advantage. If you don’t use this benefit before the start of your next turn, it is lost.

Eyes of the Dead. You can use an action to name a place the humanoid saw in life, which creates an invisible sensor somewhere in that place if it is on the plane of existence you’re currently on. The sensor remains for as long as you concentrate, up to 10 minutes (as if you were concentrating on a spell). You receive visual and auditory information from the sensor as if you were in its space using your senses.

A creature that can see the sensor (such as one using [see invisibility](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/see-invisibility) or [truesight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Truesight)) sees a translucent image of the tormented humanoid whose soul you caged.

SUNBEAM

6th-­level Evocation (ritual)

Casting Time: 1 Action 

Range: Self (60 ft Line)

Components: V, S, M

Duration: Concentration 1 Minute

A beam of brilliant light flashes out from your hand in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long line. Each creature in the line must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 radiant damage and is [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Blinded) until your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Blinded) by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.

You can create a new line of radiance as your action on any turn until the spell ends.

For the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines in your hand. It sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This light is sunlight.
