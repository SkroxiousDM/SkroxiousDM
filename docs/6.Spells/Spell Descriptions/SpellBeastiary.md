Expertise. The daemon has expertise in all its skills.<br>
Wrest Knowledge. The summoner can use its action to make a contested Charisma check with the daemon to receive information. On a success the daemon provides a useful answer to an open-­ended question or a definitive answer to a yes-­or-­no question. On a failure, the daemon refuses to answer any more questions. If the summoner offers a blood sacrifice they have advantage on their Charisma check.

Dominate. The daemon selects a creature within 30 feet. That creature must make a Charisma saving throw (DC 15) or become charmed by the daemon, following its instructions (the creature will not harm itself, however). At the end of its turn the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself. A daemon inside a magic circle cannot use this feature.<br>
