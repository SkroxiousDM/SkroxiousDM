The following provides a list of each mystical Approach’s spells, from cantrips to 5th level. New spells and core spells that needed adaptation for Ruins of Symbaroum are included in the next section. Otherwise you can find the spells in the core rules.

There is one important exception to the normal rules – the spell summon daemon is only available to sorcerers who have taken the Demonologist feat. That is why it is not included in this listing but is available in the detailed list that follows.

Important Notes

If a spell appears in the core rules (Spells (SRD) Compendium) without significant changes, it is listed here but not included in the detailed spell list. If a spell that is not included in the detailed list has a material component cost listed in gold pieces (gp) higher than 50 gp, the actual cost is half that value in thaler (e.g. a 100 gp material component costs 50 thaler, a 25 gp component costs 25 thaler).

Spells in *semibold italics* can be cast as rituals.

Spells with an asterisk (`*`) *cannot be favored.*
