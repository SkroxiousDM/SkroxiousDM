Spell Descriptions
The following spells draw on the mythos and themes. While they are balanced with existing spells, many don’t allow
saving throws. Their damage is designed with this in mind, much like Magic Missile. The spells intend to capture the
horrid, inevitable nature of the mythos. Most of them rely on Concentration as a central mechanic, forcing the spell’s
target to harm or defeat the caster to end an effect.
Body Warping of Gorgoroth
Level 1 Transmutation (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: Self
Components: S
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

to manifest in the nearest unoccupied space. For 1 hour, it acts as it wishes but treats you as an ally if you don’t take

against it.

rolled to the total.
If the total is greater than the target’s Strength, it has Disadvantage on Strength-based attacks.

You contact a deity of the Cthulhu Mythos. You can ask the entity 1d6 questions that can be answered with yes or no.
You must ask your questions before the spell ends. You receive a correct answer for each question. Old Ones aren’t
necessarily omniscient, so you might receive “unclear” as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies
beyond the Old One’s knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could be misleading or contrary to the Old One’s
interests, the GM might offer a short phrase as an answer instead.
When you cast this spell, roll a d20. If you roll a 1, the deity appears in the nearest unoccupied space and attacks
creatures (including you) in the area for the spell’s duration before returning to its realm.

an ally, it takes the Dash action and moves away from its nearest ally by the safest route unless there is nowhere to
move.
A creature becomes filled with spite as it tries to spread the disease to its enemies. It takes the Dash action and moves
