# Actions in Combat

When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your class or some other feature, or you can attempt to improvise an action (see the "Improvising" section later in this chapter.

Certain features might grant you the option to take an action as a minor action, reaction, object interaction, or even no action at all. For instance, the Scoundrel's Cunning Action feature lets them take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide actions as a minor action on their turn. Alternatively, you might use your minor action to take the Arcane action when you cast a spell with a casting time of one minor action. Most Focus features require no action at all, despite using the Focus action.

## Arcane
When you take the Arcane action, you cast an arcanic spell. Certain arcanic school features might also use the Arcane action, as described by the feature.

## Brace
When you take the Brace action, you concentrate on steadying your body. Until the start of your next turn, you make Fortitude saving throws with advantage. Additionally, you have advantage on ability checks to avoid forced movement. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated (as explained in appendix A).

## Center
When you take the the Center action, you devote yourself to strengthening your mind. Until the start of your next turn, you make Concentration and Will saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are stupefied (as explained in appendix A).

## Compel
When you take the Compel action, you suggest a single course of action to a creature that can see or hear you and reasonably understand you. Make a Charisma check depending on how you attempt to influence the creature, as determined by the GM. You might use Persuasion to convince a humanoid to help you or Wrangling to convince a beast to flee. The result of the check determines whether or not the creature follows the course of action describe:

COMPEL RESPONSES

|DC |Response|
|:---:|:---:|
|10|The creature does not do as asked, providing no help but also doing no harm.|
|15|The creature does as asked, provided no risk or sacrifice is involved|
|20|The creature does as asked, provided only minor risk or sacrifice is involved|
|25|The creature does as asked, even if major risk or sacrifice is involved.|

The DCs provided assume the creature's disposition is Indifferent. Add 5 to the DC for each disposition tier is Indifferent. Add 5 to the DC for each disposition tier below Indifferent and subtract 5 for each disposition tier above Indifferent.

If you fail to meet a DC, the creature's disposition towards you drops by one tier until you successfully Compel the creature or the creature completes a long rest. Conversely, on an exceptional result as determined by the GM, the creature's disposition towards you might increase by one tier until the creature completes a long rest.

## Dash
When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn equal to your speed. With a speed of 30 feet, for instance, you gain an additional 30 feet of movement.

If an effect increases or decreases your speed, this also affects this additional movement you. For instance, if your speed is reduced to 20 feet, you would only gain an additional 20 feet of movement from this action.

## Disengage
When you take the Disengage action, moving out of a hostile creature's reach doesn't provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the tur

## Dodge
When you take the Dodge action, you focus on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, you make Reflex saving throws with advantage. Additionally, attack rolls made against you have disadvantage provided you can see the attacker. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated (as explained in appendix F).

## Fight
When you take the Fight action, you make a single melee or ranged weapon attack, whether you are you swinging a sword, firing a gun, or brawling with your fists. The "Making an Attack" section later in this chapter explains the rules for attacking.

## Focus
When you take the Focus action, you utilize a focus saction, you utilize a focus feature that requires expending a focus point. Certain other focus school features might also use the Focus action, as described by the feature.

## Guard
When you take the Guard action, you focus entirely on preventing attacks from reaching an ally. Until the star of your next turn, any attack roll made against the guarded ally has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, as long as the ally is within 5 feet of you

Additionally, if an attack would hit the guarded ally, you can instead have it hit you (no action required). If you do so, the attacker chooses the maximum amount of damage instead of rolling.

## Help
When you take the Help action, you lend aid to an ally in one of the following two ways:

1. Ability Check: An ally within 5 feet of you gains advantage on the first ability check it makes before the start of your next turn, provided you could reasonably assist them in the check.

2. Attack Roll: An ally gains advantage on the first

attack roll it makes before the start of your next turn on a hostile creature within 5 feet of you, provided you could reasonably enhance your ally's attack in some way.

## Hide
When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules in chapter 7 for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the "Unseen Attackers and Targets" section later in this chapter.

## Ready
When you take the Ready action, you prepare to act are an when particular circumstances are met. Readying an action lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn.

First, you choose was circumstances will trigger your Readied action. Second, in response to the trigger, you determine what action you will take or if you will move up to your speed. For instance, you might choose that if a hostile creature if n 10 feet if you, you will move away from it.

When the trigger occurs, you can either take your or vou can to reaction right after it resolves or you can choose to ignore it.

If you ready an action that would grant movement, and that feature is triggered and resolved outside of your turn, you can move the amount provided by the action.

When you ready a power, you cast it as normal but its effects don't immediately take place. To ready a power, it must have a casting time of 1 action or minor action, and it requires concentration. If your i concentration is broken, the power dissipates without taking effect. Resources are only expended if you cast the readied power.

## Search
When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something by making a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check, depending on the nature of your search.

## Study
When you take the Study action, you make an Intelligence (Investigation) check contested by the target's Charisma (Deception) check in order to discern certain information about the creature. On a success, you learn information about the creature. Choose two of the following:

of Hi

Highest ability score

Lowest ability score

Strongest saving throw

Weakest saving throw

Condition immunities

Conditions suffering

Maximum number of Hit Di

Damage vulnerabilities

Damage resistances

mage immunities

Max psionic talent level

Max tech power level

est spell sio

Max maneuver level

Max focus points

## Superiority
When you take the Superiority action, you use a superior tactic. Certain superior school features might also use the Superiority action, as described by the feature.

## Taunt
When you take the Taunt action, you attempt to compel a creature to attack you instead of your allies. compel a creature to attack you instead of your allies. The target must make a Will saving throw (DC 8+ your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier). On a failed save, the target becomes Taunted by you until the end of f your your next turn.

If a creature friendly to you deals damage to a creature Taunted by you in this way, the Ttaunted creature no longer has disadvantage on attack rolls against the friendly creature.

You can only have one creature taunted in this way at a time.

## Use

When you take the Use action, you utilize an object, item, or similar effect. If you would normally have to item, of similar effect. ir you would hormally have to use your object interaction to draw the item you are using, you can instead do so as part of the Use action.

## Improvising
Your characti pt to do things not covered by other actions, such as breaking down doors. When you describe an action not otherwise included in the rules, the GM tells you whether or not it is possible and what ability tests, if any, is required.

## HIDE [ACTION]
With the Hide action, you try to prevent people from knowing where you are (or possibly that you are there at all). To do so, you must be in a Concealable Location, such as being Heavily Obscured, behind Three-Quarters Cover or Total Cover, or otherwise out of an observer’s line of sight.

When attempting to Hide, you make a DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth) check. On a successful check, you gain the Hidden condition against all observers with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score lower than your check. If any new observers enter the area, you also gain the Hidden condition against them if their passive Wisdom (Perception) score is lower than your check.

When an observer takes the Search action, they can immediately attempt a Wisdom (Perception) check against the DC set by the Hidden character’s Dexterity (Stealth) check. You lose the benefits of the Hidden condition against any creature who succeeds at the Wisdom (Perception) check or who can otherwise see you (because they’re on the same side of the wall you’re hiding behind or due to a magical effect, for example).

Observers remain aware of where they last saw you or detected you.

## Free Item Interaction
At any time during your combat turn, you have one free interaction with your inventory or the environment. You can draw a onehanded or two-handed weapon, or draw any Prepared items from worn containers (sheaths, quivers, belt pouches, Bandoliers, etc..). You can also interact with one feature of the environment (such as opening or closing a door, kicking a table).

If you want to interact with a second object, draw an item from a backpack container, manipulate an object such as magic item or a complex activity that requires an Ability check, you need to use your action (see Player's Handbook, pg. 190).

## Realistic Stand from Prone
Rising from a throw or fall is a difficult thing in the heat of battle. It takes training and skill to do so very quickly and even more so when faced with an aggressive adversary.

Standing provokes an opportunity attack from all threatening creatures unless you make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) skill check at DC 10 + 2 for each enemy engaged with you. If any opportunity attack roll beats your AC by 10 or more, you remain prone.

Creatures that are knocked prone usually fall in supine position. In order to attempt a Strength (Athletics) saving throw to stand up, they must spend an additional 5 ft movement to turn around.

If you beat the Stand from Prone DC by 5 or more, you may also choose to tumble 5 feet into unoccupied space and stand up there.

## Hitting Cover
If an attack misses a creature only due to an AC bonus from cover, the attack hits said cover. If that cover was another creature, that creature suffers the effects of the attack.

## Torch in Combat
A torch can be held off-hand in combat. When wielded, you can use your bonus action to force an adjacent enemy to make a Dex save or be blinded until the start of their next turn. Creatures that are not accustomed to sunlight have disadvantage on that save.

## Sacrifice Shield
When you take a critical hit, you can use your reaction to block it and sacrifice your shield, turning the critical hit into a regular hit. Afterwards your shield is broken, or if your shield is magical it instead becomes mundane for 1 hour.

## EXERT
Once per round, a player can have their character attempt to exert themselves.   
The character can, on their turn, spend and roll one Recovery Die. You take the rolled result as Vigor damage then you can add the rolled amount to:

- an ability check, or saving throw.
- one attack roll or damage roll of a weapon or spell attack,
- or the attack uses your bonus action instead of your action.
- or to perform a Dash action as a bonus action

If the character has Hit Dice of different sizes, they can choose which Hit Die they use.

The character can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to exert themselves, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.

## Holding your Breath
When holding your breath, the same rules used to concentrate on a spell are used to concentrate on holding your breath. For example, taking damage requires a Constitution Saving Throw. If you lose your breath by failing the Con save, you drop to the secondary rounds remaining portion of the RAW rules

 You may still concentrate on a spell that requires concentration while holding your breath. This helps make fighting underwater a bit more risky, like you would expect it to be. It helps distinguish between swimming around peacefully, and being in a violent conflict underwater; something the default rules don't do.  
 

# Standard Combat Actions
## Climb onto a Bigger Creature
If one creature wants to jump onto another creature, it can do so by grappling. A Small or Medium creature has little chance of making a successful grapple against a Huge or Gargantuan creature, however, unless magic has granted the grappler supernatural might.

As an alternative, a suitably large opponent can be treated as terrain for the purpose of jumping onto its back or clinging to a limb. After making any ability checks necessary to get into position and onto the larger creature, the smaller creature uses its action to make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by the target’s Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If it wins the contest, the smaller creature successfully moves into the target creature’s space and clings to its body. While in the target’s space, the smaller creature moves with the target and has advantage on attack rolls against it.

The smaller creature can move around within the larger creature’s space, treating the space as difficult terrain. The larger creature’s ability to attack the smaller creature depends on the smaller creature’s location, and is left to your discretion. The larger creature can dislodge the smaller creature as an action—knocking it off, scraping it against a wall, or grabbing and throwing it—by making a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the smaller creature’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. The smaller creature chooses which ability to use.

## Cleaving through Creatures
If your player characters regularly fight hordes of lower-level monsters, consider using this optional rule to help speed up such fights.

When a melee attack reduces an undamaged creature to 0 hit points, any excess damage from that attack might carry over to another creature nearby. The attacker targets another creature within reach and, if the original attack roll can hit it, applies any remaining damage to it. If that creature was undamaged and is likewise reduced to 0 hit points, repeat this process, carrying over the remaining damage until there are no valid targets, or until the damage carried over fails to reduce an undamaged creature to 0 hit points.

## Unarmed Strike
Instead of using a weapon to make a melee attack, you can use a punch, kick, headbutt, or similar forceful blow. In game terms, this is an Unarmed Strike—a melee attack that involves you using your body to damage, grapple, or shove a target within 5 feet of you.

Whenever you use your Unarmed Strike, choose one of the following options for its effect.
- **Damage**. You make an attack roll against the target. Your bonus to the roll equals your Strength modifier plus your Proficiency Bonus. On a hit, the target takes Bludgeoning damage equal to 1 plus your Strength modifier.
- **Grapple**. The target must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (it chooses which), or it has the Grappled condition. The DC for the saving throw and any escape attempts equals 8 plus your Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus. This grapple is possible only if the target is no more than one size larger than you and if you have a hand free to grab it.
- **Shove**. The target must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (it chooses which), or you either push it 5 feet away or cause it to have the Prone condition. The DC for the saving throw equals 8 plus your Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus. This shove is possible only if the target is no more than one size larger than you.

See also “Grappling.”

## Escaping a Grapple
Instead of your whole action (Player's Handbook, pg. 195), you may use any of your attacks to attempt an escape from grapple. To attempt an Escape, make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw DC 8 plus the strength modifier of the creature grappling you. If you succeed, you lose the Grappled condition. If your roll a natural 1 or your result is an exceptional failure, you fail and can't attempt any more Escape attempts until your next turn.

Grappled creatures with the Multiattack ability may use this ability as Multiescape instead. For each attack described as part of the Multiattack, they get one escape attempt. If the Multiattack includes more than one set of attacks, use the set with the most attacks.

## Flanking
Dungeon Master's Guide (pg. 251) 
		**Optional Rule: Flanking**
		If you regularly use miniatures, flanking gives combatants a simple way to gain advantage on attack rolls against a common enemy.
		A creature can’t flank an enemy that it can’t see. A creature also can’t flank while it is incapacitated. A Large or larger creature is flanking as long as at least one square or hex of its space qualifies for flanking.
		**Flanking on Squares.** When a creature and at least one of its allies are adjacent to an enemy and on opposite sides or corners of the enemy’s space, they flank that enemy, and each of them has advantage on melee attack rolls against that enemy.
		When in doubt about whether two creatures flank an enemy on a grid, trace an imaginary line between the centers of the creatures’ spaces. If the line passes through opposite sides or corners of the enemy’s space, the enemy is flanked.

introduces flanking as an easy way to gain advantage and exploit a common enemy. To make it more realistic, at the beginning of your turn while being flanked you may choose one of the attackers that are flanking you and deny them the benefit of flanking until the start of your next turn. You can choose a different attacker that is flanking you during each of your turns.

## Disarming
A creature can use a weapon attack to knock a weapon or another item from a target’s grasp. The attacker makes an attack roll against a DC equal to 10 + Strength Saving Throw or Dexterity Saving Throw modifier of the target (its choice). The attacker has advantage on their attack roll if they grappled using Opportunity Grapple (pg. 19) or with a weapon with the Grappling property (pg. 36) or if they are larger than the target. The attacker has disadvantage on their attack roll if the target is holding the item with two or more hands, or if they are smaller than the target. If you succeed, the weapon, shield or item is no longer held by the target. You can use your item interaction to either kick the weapon into an adjacent area (your choice) or take the item if you have a free hand, otherwise the target may use its item interaction on their turn to take it back.

## Marking
The Dungeon Master's Guide (pg. 271) 
		**Mark**
		This option makes it easier for melee combatants to harry each other with opportunity attacks.
		When a creature makes a melee attack, it can also mark its target. Until the end of the attacker’s next turn, any opportunity attack it makes against the marked target has advantage. The opportunity attack doesn’t expend the attacker’s reaction, but the attacker can’t make the attack if anything, such as the incapacitated condition or the shocking grasp spell, is preventing it from taking reactions. The attacker is limited to one opportunity attack per turn
  
introduces marking as a way to harry each other with opportunity attacks. This rule overrides the original effect. When you use the Mark action, you gain a second reaction that can only be used for opportunity attack provoked by your marked target, and only this attack benefits from advantage. However, you cannot perform reactions against any hostile creatures other than your marked target until the end of your next turn.

# Combat Options
Combat Options are common martial techniques available to anyone of any class. You can perform Combat Options only if you are proficient with the weapon you are wielding. Combat Options with [Action]  take your whole Action. Options with [Attack] replace one of your Attacks and if you can make multiple attacks only one can be used as a Combat Option. Options with [Movement] use your Movement. Options with [Reaction] can be used anytime you can use your reaction. Options with [Opportunity] can be used instead of an opportunity attack. Combat Options with [Superiority] allow classes with access to superiority dice to spend a die and add its total to both Attack and Damage roll.

# Melee Strikes
## Power Attack [Attack]  [Superiority] (not Finesse)
Before you make an attack with a melee weapon, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll and attempt to put more of your raw strength behind a powerful blow.

If the attack hits, you add 2 + your Strength modifier (minimum 1) to the attack's damage.

## Feint [Attack]  [Superiority] (Finesse)
Before you make an attack with a finesse melee weapon that you are proficient with, you can spend your bonus action and perform a feint to deceive your target.

Make an attack roll opposed by the target's Passive Insight. If you succeed, you have advantage on your next attack and you benefit from Dominance against your target until the start of your next turn. If you fail you have disadvantage on the next attack roll and you cannot succeed a Feint against this target for the rest of the encounter.

## Shove / Trip [Attack]  [Opportunity]  [Superiority]  (Reach, Polearm, or Shield)
While wielding a melee weapon with the Reach property, or any Polearm weapon, or a shield larger than a buckler, you can spend one of your attacks to perform the Shove a Creature action (see Unarmed Strike Above) without the need of a free hand. if you are proficient in the weapon you may add it to the save DC.

## Stagger [Attack]  [Superiority] (Bludgeoning)
Before you make a melee attack with a bludgeoning weapon, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll and try to disrupt the movement of your target while attacking.

If the target takes damage, the target's movement speed is reduced by 10 until the end of its next turn. If its speed is reduced to 0 in this way, it immediately drops prone. Until the target recovers its movement speed to full it cannot use the Dash, Disengage and Dodge actions.

# Melee Reactions
## Deflect  [Reaction]  [Superiority] (not Finesse)
When a creature that you can see declares a melee attack against you and you have Dominance over your target, you may use your reaction to attempt to deflect the attack. You can attempt to deflect only before damage is rolled. Attacks by Flexible weapons (such as flails) cannot be deflected.

If you do and you are proficient with the weapon that you are currently wielding, roll your weapon damage dice without any modifiers. The damage is reduced by that result.

**Riposte.** If your weapon has the Parry property and your Deflect result negates all attack damage, you can follow up with a single melee attack against the same target.

## Counter  [Reaction]  [Superiority] (Finesse or Parry)
When a creature misses you with a melee attack by 10 or more and you have Dominance over it, you may use your reaction to perform a single melee attack against that creature. You cannot Counter while using the Dodge action.

## Opportunity Grapple  [Reaction]  [Opportunity]  (Free Hand)
You use one of your free hands to reach out and attempt to grapple an opponent.

Make a Grapple check (see Unarmed Strike Above). If this opportunity grapple is provoked by a movement and you succeed, both you and the opponent move 5 feet in the direction the target tried to move into and the target's speed becomes 0.

## Give Ground  [Reaction]  [Superiority]
When you are hit with a melee attack and you haven't moved during your last turn, you can use your reaction to move 5 feet away from the creature, reducing the damage you take by 1d6 points (minimum of 1), as long as your movement speed is greater than 0. This movement does not provoke an opportunity attack from the attacker, and the attacker may immediately follow you into the space you just left as a free action.

You cannot Give Ground while you are grappled by any creature, or knocked prone. You cannot Give Ground if you are already on, or would walk into difficult terrain.

# Ranged Actions
## Aim [Movement] (Ranged Weapon)
If your target hasn't moved during its previous turn, you can spend your movement to stand still, hold your breath and aim with a ranged weapon. Until the end of this turn, your next ranged attack against that target has advantage.

Aiming requires concentration. If you maintain spells requiring Concentration, Aiming causes them to end.

# Movement Actions
## Charge [Movement]   [Action]   [Superiority]
When you move at least 20 feet towards a target, you may declare a charge attack as an action. You must have a clear path towards your target, and nothing should hinder your path (such as difficult terrain or obstacles). If you finish your movement within reach of your target, you may use your action to follow it with one of these options:

**Strike.**
Your may make a single melee attack with advantage. The attack deals additional damage equal to the distance you charged divided by 5, up to your Strength or Constitution modifier (your choice, minimum of 1). If you are riding a mounted animal that provides the movement instead of you, you may use its Strength or Constitution instead your own.

**Slam.**
You may perform the Shove action (see Unarmed Strike Above) with advantage. If you succeed, the creature is shoved twice the normal distance, or shoved as normal then knocked prone. You may choose to move up to five feet in the direction you are shoving your target. If you fail, you provoke an attack of opportunity from your target.

**Tackle.** 
You may make a single Grapple attempt with advantage. If the Grapple fails, you provoke an attack of opportunity from your target and are knocked prone. If you succeed, both you and your opponent are knocked prone and your target is subjected to the Grappled condition.

## Drive Back [Attack]
Using one of your Attacks, you attempt to force back a standing creature. The target must be no larger than you in size. Make a Charisma (Intimidation) check against DC 10 + the target's Wisdom (Insight) check. If you have Dominance over your target, you have advantage to your Intimidation check.

If you win the contest, the target backs away from you by 5 feet.

As part of this attack, you can move 5 feet in the direction of the target. If you lose the contest, you provoke an attack of opportunity from the target or it may choose to use its reaction to perform a Drive Back action.

## Brace [Movement]
You can spend your movement to move up to half your speed to a solid object and brace yourself for additional support. This requires the use of both hands. For as long as you maintain your grip, any checks to move you or knock you prone are made with disadvantage. Furthermore, saving throws to resist being moved or knocked prone are made with advantage.

Once braced, you can maintain this effect as long as you do not release your grip or use your hands for anything else. If you are moved further than 5 feet away from the braced object, or knocked prone, the effect end

## Lunge [Attack] (Piercing, not Heavy or Light)
If you have Dominance over your target, you can make a special melee weapon attack that extends the reach of your weapon by 5 feet. You provoke opportunity attacks from enemies within 5 feet of you.

# Special Actions
## Dirty Fighting [Attack] (Free Hand)
Dirty fighting is a catch-all name for many socially rejected grappling techniques that exploit the opponent.

If you have Dominance over your target, you can change one of your attacks into a dirty move from the list below. Engage in a Grapple check with your target. If you fail, you provoke an attack of opportunity from your opponent. If you succeed, apply the dirty move effect.

**Restrain.**
The target is grappled and restrained by you.

**Headlock.**
The target is grappled by you and suffocating (Player's Handbook, pg. 183) until the grapple is broken.

**Eyejab.** 
The target is Blinded until the end of its next turn. You may also Shove the creature as part of the Dirty Trick, but at disadvantage.

**Groin shot.**
The target is Stunned until the end of its next turn. You may also Shove the creature as part of the Dirty Trick, but at disadvantage.

Once you use a dirty move against a target, you cannot succeed with the same trick again until end of combat.

## Sunder   [Action]  [Superiority] (Heavy or Sundering)
You can spend your action to deliver a series of blows aimed at chinks in a creature's armor or shield. Instead of damage to the target, you attempt to apply the Sundered condition to HeavyArmor (or a component with the Hard property, if you use Realistic Armors, pg. 28). Flexible armors such as chain mail, and materials such as leather cannot be Sundered.

Make a single melee attack against the target, and you get advantage to that attack. If it hits, roll for damage. You cannot apply class abilities or spells that award extra damage dice such as Smite or Sneak Attack. For each extra attack you can do in a round, add 2 to the damage. If the target is Grappled or Prone, add 2 to the damage for each condition. If your weapon has the Sundering property, add 5 to the damage.

If the damage total is equal to or higher than the creature's armor Hardness (the hardenss of Iron and Steel is 19, for others check the Dungeon Master's Guide, pg. 246), you sunder the armor or shield (your choice). Sundered armor or shields decrease their bonus to AC by 2 until repaired. Sundered armor or shields cannot be sundered again. For optional rules, check Armor Degradation (pg. 31).

You can also sunder smaller items if held in a hand (up to DM's decision) but the Sunder attack roll must be made at disadvantage.

## Body-Shield [Movement] (Restrained Target)
While a creature is Restrained or Pinned (pg. 14) by you, you may use half your movement to make a Grapple check against that creature in order to position it in such a way that it shields you from one or more hostile creatures that you are aware of. If the creature is of your size it provides half cover and +2 AC, or, if the creature is one size larger than you, three-quarters cover and +5 AC.

If the creature you shield yourself with becomes stunned, paralyzed or unconscious, when attacked make a Strength (Athletics) check at DC 15 plus 5 for each size category above yours. On a failure, you do not benefit from the cover.

# Stealth Actions
## Distraction   [Action]  
While you are hidden from a creature, you throw a pebble or make a sound meant to confuse and distract them. You must be aware of the creature's approximate location or direction of movement.

Make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) or Charisma (Performance) check depending on your distraction method, contested by Wisdom (Insight) or Intelligence (Investigation) check (the targets choose the ability to use). If the creatures is alert, Passive Insight or Passive Investigation applies.

If you succeed, the creature is Distracted until the end of its next turn. Distracted creatures have disadvantage to Wisdom (Perception) skill checks and cannot use their Passive Perception.

You have advantage on attacks and grapple checks against any Distracted creature, and if grappled while Distracted it is Surprised until the end of its next turn.

If you fail, you provoke a Wisdom (Perception) check with advantage from your targets opposed by your Dexterity (Stealth) skill. Your Passive Stealth (pg. 25) does not apply.

## Stealth Grapple [Attack]
While you are hidden from your target, as long as your Stealth check total or Passive Stealth are above the Passive Perception of all nearby targets, you can come out of stealth and perform an opposed Grapple check with advantage. If you succeed, you may use your reaction to follow it with one of the following effects. If you fail, you provoke an attack of opportunity or grapple of opportunity from your target.

The chosen effect applies as long as the stealth grapple is maintained. While maintaining it, creatures other than your target have advantage on attack rolls against you, and you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.

**Gag.** 
You attempt to gag the target's mouth to prevent it from making any sound. Make another opposed Grapple check with your target. On a success, the target is gagged until the grapple ends. A gagged creature cannot cast spells with verbal components and its speech is muffled and difficult to understand.

**Choke Hold.** 
You try to grab the creature by the throat and prevent it from breathing. Make another opposed Grapple check with your target. you have disadvantage on your roll. On a success, the target is also gagged and suffocating until the grapple ends. (Player's Handbook, pg. 183).

**Silent Takedown.** 
If your target is already grappled and gagged, you may attempt to strike it with a weapon with the Finesse or Concealed property. Make a Grapple check to maintain the hold on your target. If you succeed, you can make a single special melee attack. Your target has vulnerability towards the damage dealt by that attack.

## Stealth Drag [Movement]
While you are grappling a creature that is unable to speak, you may attempt to return to stealth. The Stealth check is made at disadvantage. On a success, the movement speed penalty from dragging a grappled creature does not apply.

## Coup de Grace [Attack]
When you make an attack that qualifies as an automatic critical hit against a defenseless target, roll a regular Attack roll. If you hit the target's AC minus Dexterity modifier, the creature takes damage equal to its current HP and is dying.

If you miss, the creature instead takes damage equal to half its current HP.


# Maneuver Options
The maneuvers are presented here in alphabetical order.

## Ambush
