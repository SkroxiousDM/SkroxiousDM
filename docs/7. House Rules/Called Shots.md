Called shots can really break the combat mechanics of 5E for various reasons I won't go into here. But there is something very cinematic about called shots in combat that feeds the imagination, and adds a level of potential heroism that isn't possible otherwise. Imagine the Hobbit (the book) without Bard's incredible shot with the black bow to Smaug's missing scale. Or if Theseus couldn't behead Medusa with a single, well planned strike.

I have used some called shots systems in the past, and yes, they are broken, but they have been very fun for my players. Here's a pretty basic example that you can try:

• The PC describes their attack, i.e., what they intend to strike, and the intended effect, "I'm going to use my greataxe to chop the constrictor snake's head off!"

• They must then prepare for the strike for a minimum of three rounds. During this time, they can use the move, hide, dodge, or disengage actions, but no other actions as they plan their strike.

• On the 4th round or later, they can roll to hit with disadvantage (only with the planned weapon or attack spell). The disadvantage cannot be changed to "normal" under any circumstances, magical or otherwise. Period.

• The attack does maximum triple-dice damage (a greataxe would do 36 damage + all other modifiers).

•If the total = half the total remaining HP of the enemy, the creature is slain, in the manner planned by the PC. i.e., the minotaur's head is lopped off, or the arrow pierces the beholder's eye, entering its brain to kill it. The damage must match the weapon type (no beheading with a firebolt).

•If they miss, they must plan for another 3 rounds before making another attempt.

This rule makes called shots very difficult to pull off, but keeps players from spamming the rule. Feel free to adjust the number of rounds it takes to prepare the called shot, or do away with the permanent disadvantage. But be careful that your players don't find a way to abuse it.
