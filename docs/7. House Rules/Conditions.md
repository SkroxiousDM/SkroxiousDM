# Conditions
A condition is a temporary game state. The definition of a condition says how it affects its recipient, and various rules define how to end a condition. This glossary defines these conditions:
# Blinded
- When blinded, a creature cannot see. Many checks may be impossible for the blinded creature (like using a perception check to spot someone in a crowd).
- A blinded creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and dexterity saving throws.
- Attacks made against a blinded creature have advantage.
- A blinded creature's speed is halved.
- A blinded creature cannot make attacks of opportunity. because it cannot see the creature moving away.
- A blinded creature does not have line of sight for spellcasting.
The blinded condition in 5e is not always intuitive. An archer can attack any creature they want while blinded, only suffering disadvantage.
## Partially Blinded
- You have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
# Burning
A burning creature or object takes 1d4 Fire damage at the start of each of its turns. As an action, you can extinguish fire on yourself by giving yourself the [Prone] condition and rolling on the ground. The fire also goes out if it is doused, submerged, or suffocated.
# Charmed
A creature that is charmed is charmed _by_ a single creature. A charmed creature is in control of their actions.
- The charmed creature cannot attack or otherwise cause any harm knowingly to the creature that charmed them, unless compelled to by other magic.
- The charmer has advantage on all checks to socially interact with the charmed creature.
A charmed creature might be in awe of their charmer or consider them very likeable, even if that would not normally make sense.
# Concentrating
Some spells or abilities have ongoing effects that only persist as long as the caster maintains focus on the effect. 
- A concentrating creature maintains an ongoing effect. If concentration ends, so does the linked effect.
- If a concentrating creature starts concentrating on a different effect, they stop concentrating on the first effect.
- When a concentrating creature takes damage, they must succeed on a constitution saving throw, with a DC equal to 10 or half the damage they took rounded down (whichever is higher) or lose their concentration.
- If a concentrating creature becomes [Incapacitated], they lose their concentration.
# Confused
A confused creature can't accurately understand their surroundings, and act in random, potentially harmful ways.
- On a confused creature's turns, they roll a d10 to determine what they do.

|d10 Result|Action|
|---|---|
|1-3|The creature uses their movement and moves as far as they can in a random direction, going around obstacles. On a square grid, roll a d8, with 1 meaning that they move north and the rest of the numbers on the d8 assigned clockwise. On a hexagonal grid, roll a d6 and do the same. If the creature can't move in the chosen direction, they don't move. The creature can still use their action.|
|4-6|The creature uses their action to say something nonsensical or out of context.|
|7-8|The creature attacks the closest creature, moving first if neccesary, using whatever weapon they might be holding. Creatures use extra attack/multiattack, and creatures without a weapon make an unarmed strike.|
|9-10|The creature gains a moment of clarity, and can act normally.|

# Cover
A creature has cover when they are partially blocked by terrain or obstacles. Unless otherwise stated, creatures do not provide cover. A creature might have cover against one enemy and not another.
## Half Cover
If at least half of the creature's body is covered, or if the creature is shooting from around a corner or behind a small obstacle, they have half cover.
- A creature with half cover has +2 to their armor class and dexterity saving throws against creatures and effects they have cover from.
## Three Quarters Cover
If at least three quarters, but not all, of the creature's body is covered, they have three quarters cover. This extends even if only a small part of the creature is visible, such as with an arrow slit in a castle wall.
- A creature with three quarters cover has +5 to their armor class and dexterity saving throws against creatures and effects they have cover from.
## Full Cover
If all of the creature's body is covered, they have full cover.
- A creature with full cover cannot be targeted by attacks or spells from creatures they have cover from. 
Most of the time, it should be obvious that a creature with full cover cannot be targeted.
# Dazed
A dazed creature has limited functionality on their turn.
- At the start of their turn, a dazed creature must choose whether to move or take an action or bonus action, but can only do one of the three.
- A dazed creature cannot use reactions.
# ​Deafened
A deafened creature cannot hear and their inner ear is of limited functionality, affecting balance.
- When deafened, a creature cannot hear. Some checks may be impossible for the deafened creature (like using a perception check to overhear a conversation through a door).
- While deafened, you are immune to spells and effects that require you to hear words or other sounds.
- A deafened creature has disadvantage on dexterity saves and skill checks.
# Dominance
When you have advantage on your attack rolls against your target and your target doesn't have the same benefit against you, or a hostile creature that attacks you has disadvantage to its attack rolls and you don't suffer the same penalty, this condition is called having Dominance. You also benefit from Dominance if your target is standing on difficult terrain while you are not, or you hold the higher ground position on steep terrain.
Some [Actions in Combat] require Dominance as prerequisite for their use during combat. Some combat options or abilities may also allow you to benefit from Dominance even if the conditions above are not met.
# Drained
A drained creature has had their vitality or even their core abilities decreased temporarily, such as by disease or a shadow's sapping touch. When a creature is drained, either their hit point maximum or one of their ability scores is temporarily lowered.
- If a creature suffers hit point drain, their maximum hit point total is reduced. Their hit points cannot be higher than that temporary maximum, and if their maximum hit point total reaches 0, they die. A creature that has had their hit point maximum reduced is more likely to die to massive damage. As normal, if an attack reduces a creature to 0 hit points or hits a creature with 0 hit points and deals excess damage equal to or greater than their new hit point maximum, they die.
- If a creature suffers ability score drain, one of their ability scores (such as strength) is reduced temporarily. Everything affected by that ability score is also reduced accordingly.
- The drained condition is always removed at the end of a long rest, unless caused by an effect (such as a disease) that says otherwise.
# Encumbered
- your speed drops by 10 feet.
## Heavily Encumbered
- your speed drops by 20 feet 
- you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.
# ​Exhausted
A creature that is exhausted has been pushed beyond their body's normal limits. For an exhausted creature, both mind and body are starting to fail.
- Levels 1-3 of Exhaustion (called Soft) often happen with strenuous activity like working, training or fighting. Soft Exhaustion accumulates easily but is recovered quickly with a short or longer rest. Any rule or DM decision that makes you gain Soft Exhaustion increases your Exhaustion only if your current Exhaustion is level 2 or less.
- If you have reached the maximum level of Soft Exhaustion and you take another level of it, instead of increasing your Exhaustion level you lose one Recovery die. If you have no Recovery dice left, your Exhaustion increases as normal
- Levels 4-6 of Exhaustion come in play when you push past your limits or your life is being drained. If you have 4 or more levels of Exhaustion, you may recover a level of Exhaustion only during long or full rest.
- For each level of exhaustion a creature has, they suffer a -2 penalty to attack rolls, skill checks, saving throws, and their spellcasting DC if they have one, as well as -5 to their movement speeds.
- If a creature reaches 6 levels of exhaustion, they gain two wound levels. Any additional Exhaustion counts as two wound levels.
# Frightened
A creature that is frightened is frightened _by_ the source of their fear, which is usually a creature, but could be an object or something else. 
- The frightened creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks (including skill checks) while within line of sight of the source of their fear.
- A frightened creature cannot approach the source of their fear except if they must briefly get closer as part of their movement to end their movement further away.
-  If a frightened creature is subjected to an effect that causes it to become frightened again, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw at Save DC of the source. If it fails, it becomes Panicked.
In the case where the source of the fear is invisible or hidden, the GM may rule whether the frightened creature suffers the penalties of this condition or not. An invisible hag might have frightened a character, but the character might not know the hag is in the room, and so might not have disadvantage on rolls. Or perhaps the character knows the hag is right behind a door, and is affected as if the hag was within line of sight. The GM decides whether the creature is affected in these cases.
# Goaded
A creature that is goaded is goaded _by_ a specific entity, which is usually a creature, but could be an object or something else.
- The goaded creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than the entity that goaded them.
- The goaded creature cannot willingly end their turn further from the entity that goaded them than where they started their turn.​
- A creature can only be goaded by one creature at a time. If the goaded creature is then goaded by another creature, they are no longer goaded by the first creature.
# Grappled
A grappled creature has been grabbed by another creature or hazard. Usually this requires that the grappler uses an empty hand or appendage to grab the grappled creature.
**The Grappler**​
- Can end the grapple at any time, including during another creature's turn.
- Can hang on to the grappled creature instead of falling. If the grappled creature is smaller, they both fall instead.
- Has their speed halved.
**The Grappled Creature**
- If grappled by a creature (rather than a spell or other ability), they can replace one of their weapon attacks on their turn with an escape attempt. make a Dexterity or Strength Saving Throw against the grapple’s escape DC at the end of each of the grappled creature turns, ending the Condition on themself on a success. The Condition also ends if the grappler is Incapacitated, or if any effect forces either the grappler or grappled creature to move (such as a shove attack). Size advantage or disadvantage (listed below) applies.
**If both are the same size**
- The grappled creature's speed is 0. 
- The grappled creature has  Disadvantage on Attack Rolls against any target other than the grappler.
- The grappler cannot move away from the grappled creature without ending the grapple.
**If the Grappler is two or more size categories larger**
- The grappled creature has disadvantage on the saving throw
- the grappler moves at full speed instead of half.
- The grappled creature's speed is 0, and they are [restrained] (which prevents them from grappling the larger grappler).
**If the Grappler is one size category larger**
- The grappled creature has disadvantage on the saving throw.
- The grappled creature's speed is 0.
- The larger creature can drag the smaller creature. Whenever the larger creature moves, the smaller creature moves in the same direction.
**If the Grappler is one size category smaller**
- The grappled creature has advantage on the saving throw
- The grappled creature has their speed halved. When the grappled, larger creature moves, the grappler moves too.
- The grappler counts as occupying the nearest unoccupied part of the grappled creature's space. If the grappler ends the grapple _willingly_, they choose a space within 5 ft. (or the nearest unoccupied space) to move to.
**If the Grappler is at least two size categories smaller**
- The grappled creature has advantage on the saving throw
- When the grappled, larger creature moves, the grappler moves too.
- The grappler counts as occupying the nearest unoccupied part of the grappled creature's space. If the grappler ends the grapple _willingly_, they choose a space within 5 ft. (or the nearest unoccupied space) to move to.
- If the grappler doesn't have a climb speed, their speed is 0.
- If the grappler has a climb speed, they can climb the grappled creature. The climber can expend movement to move to any other space the grappled creature occupies. The climber has advantage on attacks against the grappled creature, and the grappled creature has disadvantage to attack the climber.
# Hidden
When you have the Hidden condition, you experience the following effects.
- When you’re Hidden from a creature, they don’t know your location.
- If you are no longer in a Concealable Location or benefiting from another condition that allows you to take the Hide action, you immediately lose the Hidden condition.
- Concealed. You can’t be affected by any effect that requires its target to be seen if you are Hidden from the effect’s creator.
- Surprise. If you are Hidden from all enemies when you roll Initiative, you have Advantage on the roll.
- Combat Advantage. Attack rolls against a Hidden opponent have Disadvantage, and a Hidden opponent’s attack rolls have Advantage.
- Detectable Actions. If you make an attack or take some other loud or overt action (such as talking louder than a whisper, kicking open a door, or casting a spell with a Verbal component), other creatures will pinpoint your current location, allowing them to, for example, aim attacks at you (although you would still benefit from your Combat Advantage). In addition, taking a detectable action allows any observer you’re currently Hidden from to make a Wisdom (Perception) check to spot you (removing the benefits of the Hidden condition). Observers can use a reaction to gain advantage on this check.
- Leaving Concealment. If you are no longer in a Concealable Location or benefiting from another condition or effect that allows you to take the Hide action, you lose the Hidden condition. If this happens on your turn in combat, you lose the Hidden condition at the end of your turn. (If, after being revealed, you take the Hide action again, you can immediately regain the Hidden condition after losing it, but observes will remain aware of where they last saw or detected you.) If you Ready an action triggered by something that would reveal your location, you lose the Hidden condition at the end of your Readied action.
For example, you could Hide behind a closed door and then stab someone opening the door, while still gaining the benefits of Hidden on your attack.)
# Hasted
A hasted creature moves faster than the environment around them, usually due to a time-warping magic spell or effect.​
- A hasted creature gains a +2 bonus to their armor class and dexterity saving throws.
- A hasted creature's speed is doubled
- A hasted creature gains a 'haste action' on each of their turns. A haste action can be used to make a single attack or use one of the [Dash], [Disengage], or [Hide] actions.

# Incapacitated
The incapacitated condition refers to any condition that renders a creature unable to do anything. There are four subtypes of incapacitated. If you are affected by the [paralyzed], [petrified], [stunned], or [unconscious] conditions, you are also affected by the incapacitated condition.
- An incapacitated creature cannot use actions, bonus actions, reactions, or any other kind of actions. they can’t speak.
-  An incapacitated creature's Concentration is broken.
- An incapacitated creature's speed becomes 0, and any effect that would increase their speed has no effect while they are incapacitated.​
- An incapacitated creature automatically fails strength and dexterity saving throws or ability checks.

# Invisible
An invisible creature gains **no benefits against creatures that can see invisible creatures**.
- The invisible creature has advantage on attack rolls.
- Attack rolls against the invisible creature have disadvantage.
- The invisible creature can take the Hide action without needing to be in a Concealable Position.
- The invisible creature gains Advantage on checks that would benefit from not being seen, including Dexterity (Stealth) checks and Initiative rolls.
- The creature cannot be seen or targeted with [attacks of opportunity] or spells that require the caster to see the invisible creature.
- Anything the invisible creature is wearing or carrying becomes invisible while being carried. If the invisible creature tries to carry something that encumbers them, the item they are trying to carry is not invisible.
The invisible creature still leaves tracks and makes sound. We recommend that all creatures should know the location of an invisible creature in combat unless that creature is hiding. Note that some creatures or characters may be able to attack and hide in the same turn, and invisible creatures do not provoke attacks of opportunity, so some invisible creatures can attack, move, and then hide in an unknown location.
# Nauseated
Nauseated is a lesser variant of the Poisoned condition. It can be caused by consumption of spoiled food or exposure to toxic conditions without direct contact with poisons. Unless stated otherwise, the effect persists while exposed to its source.
- A nauseated creatures has disadvantage on its first Attack roll or Ability Check on its turn.
- If a nauseated creature is subjected to an effect that causes it to become Nauseated again, it becomes Poisoned.
- A nauseated creature can spend its action to wretch to remove the Nauseated condition.
# Obscured
A creature that is obscured is hard or impossible for other creatures to see. Like with cover, a creature may be obscured from one creature and not another.
A creature standing in low light or total darkness is obscured from creatures that can't see them with darkvision. A creature standing in low light is lightly obscured. A creature standing in total darkness is heavily obscured.
## Lightly Obscured
A creature is lightly obscured when something causes them to be hard, but not impossible, to see. Examples include low light, thick foliage, or murky water. 
- A lightly obscured creature can hide using a stealth check even if they can be partially seen (normally, a creature in plain view cannot hide).
- A lightly obscured creature has advantage on stealth checks.
## Heavily Obscured
A creature is heavily obscured when something makes them impossible to see. Examples include total darkness, thick fog, or a heavy smoke.

# Panicked
An unspeakable dread can break the will of weaker creatures and send them running for their lives.
- A panicked creature remains panicked as long as it is frightened. If it is no longer frightened, it stops panicking.
- A panicked creature must Disengage or Dash with all its movement speed from the source of its fear, as well as any other dangers it encounters, along a random path. The creature uses the Dodge action anytime it can, and will attack or interact with obstacles, use special abilities including spells as a means of escape. If cornered, a panicked creature cowers and does not attack.
- At the start of its turn, a panicking creature can attempt a Wisdom saving throw at Save DC of the source of the fear. If it succeeds, it is no longer panicked. It may continue to feign panicking to surprise any pursuers.

# Paralyzed
A paralyzed creature is [incapacitated]. While paralyzed, the creature cannot move, but typically stays standing.​
- Attacks against the paralyzed creature have advantage.

A petrified creature is [incapacitated].
A petrified creature has been transformed into stone or some other inert material. This also transforms anything the creature was carrying (with the possible exception of another creature). The petrified creature is solid, and the petrification might fill space inside or around the creature. A petrified creature's weight usually increases. For most creatures petrified as stone, their weight is multiplied by 10.
- A petrified creature's biological processes halt. The creature is completely immobile and unaware of their surroundings. The creature stops aging, and any poison or disease stops progressing or harming them, though they will resume if the creature is unpetrified.
- Attacks against the petrified creature have advantage.

- **_Ability Checks and Attacks Affected._** You have Disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.
- When a poisoned creature takes poison damage equal to or more than its Constitution modifier (minimum of one), its hit point maximum is reduced by 1d6.
- While poisoned, if a creature's hit point maximum is reduced below half than normal it suffers one level of Exhaustion that cannot be removed. This exhaustion persists even if the creature is no longer Poisoned, as long as its Vigor point maximum is  reduced below half.
- Creature's Vigor point maximum recover at the end of a long rest, as long as it is no longer Poisoned during the rest. Healing using Recovery dice or magical means also recovers the same amount to their Vigor point maximum lost this way.

- A prone creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
- An attack that is either a melee attack or made from within 5 ft. has advantage on an attack roll against a prone target.
- A ranged attack against a prone creature has disadvantage.
- A prone creature can spend half of their movement to stand up, ending the condition, or they can crawl, which costs them 3 ft. of movement for every 1 ft. they move.
# Push Conditions
If you fail a skill or attribute roll, you can choose to push the roll, which means that you make another attempt. The new result applies, whatever it is. If you have a advantage or disadvantage, you must re-roll both dice. You can never push a natural 1. Whenever you push a roll, immediately after the re-roll, you suffer a Push Condition.

On a 10 or lower, the spell is delayed and the slowed caster must use their action (or bonus action, if the spell takes a bonus action to cast) on their next turn to complete the spell. If the caster chooses not to continue casting the spell or is unable to on their next turn, the spell slot is consumed anyway. For the sake of casting multiple spells in the same turn, this counts as if the caster used the spell on both turns.

- A stunned creature is [incapacitated]
- A stunned creature can only speak in short, faltering phrases.
- Attacks against the stunned creature have advantage.
# Surprised
When combat starts and a creature did not realize there was a threat present, that creature is surprised. Usually a creature is surprised because their enemy used stealth to attack before being noticed. In an ambush scenario, the ambushing creatures roll a stealth check. If all ambushing creatures roll equal to or higher than a given target's passive perception score (which is 10 + their perception skill bonus), then the given target is surprised.

- A weakened creature does half as much damage with weapon attacks.
# Wounded
There are six levels of wounds, and they work in a similar way to Exhaustion These wound levels represent signiﬁcant injuries, like an arrow in your arm, a serious cut, or a club cracking your skull. 
You gain a Wound level when:
- you take damage that reduces your Vigor to 0
- you take damage and your current Vigor is 0.
- you take damage from a critical hit. Even if your Vigor is more than 0.
- you take damage while unconscious, stunned, paralyzed, incapacitated, or you take falling damage.
- you take damage while having the surprised condition. You can make a Dexterity or Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to 10 or half the damage, whichever is greater. If you fail the save, you take a wound level.

| Level                 | Effect                                         |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Lightly wounded    | Disadvantage on ability checks                 |
| 2. Moderately wounded | Speed halved                                   |
| 3. Bloodied           | Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws |
| 4. Brutally wounded   | Vitality point maximum halved                  |
| 5. Broken             | Speed reduced to 0                             |
| 6. Dead               | Dead                                           |

The eﬀects of being Wounded stack, just like Exhaustion does. If you have 2 wound levels, you suﬀer disadvantage on physical Ability Checks and your speed is halved.
