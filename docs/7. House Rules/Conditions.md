# Conditions
## HIDDEN [CONDITION]
When you have the Hidden condition, you experience the following effects.
- When you’re Hidden from a creature, they don’t know your location.
- If you are no longer in a Concealable Location or benefiting from another condition that allows you to take the Hide action, you immediately lose the Hidden condition.
- Concealed. You can’t be affected by any effect that requires its target to be seen if you are Hidden from the effect’s creator.
- Surprise. If you are Hidden from all enemies when you roll Initiative, you have Advantage on the roll.
- Combat Advantage. Attack rolls against a Hidden opponent have Disadvantage, and a Hidden opponent’s attack rolls have Advantage.
- Detectable Actions. If you make an attack or take some other loud or overt action (such as talking louder than a whisper, kicking open a door, or casting a spell with a Verbal component), other creatures will pinpoint your current location, allowing them to, for example, aim attacks at you (although you would still benefit from your Combat Advantage). In addition, taking a detectable action allows any observer you’re currently Hidden from to make a Wisdom (Perception) check to spot you (removing the benefits of the Hidden condition). Observers can use a reaction to gain advantage on this check.
- Leaving Concealment. If you are no longer in a Concealable Location or benefiting from another condition or effect that allows you to take the Hide action, you lose the Hidden condition. If this happens on your turn in combat, you lose the Hidden condition at the end of your turn. (If, after being revealed, you take the Hide action again, you can immediately regain the Hidden condition after losing it, but observes will remain aware of where they last saw or detected you.) If you Ready an action triggered by something that would reveal your location, you lose the Hidden condition at the end of your Readied action.<br>
For example, you could Hide behind a closed door and then stab someone opening the door, while still gaining the benefits of Hidden on your attack.)

## INVISIBLE [CONDITION]
When you have the Invisible condition, you experience the following effects.
- You cannot be seen. Any equipment you’re carrying or wearing is also invisible.
- You can take the Hide action without needing to be in a Concealable Position.
You gain Advantage on checks that would benefit from not being seen, including Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
- Attack rolls against you have Disadvantage, and your attack rolls have Advantage.
- You do not gain the benefits of Invisible against any creature who can somehow see you. (For example, due to a see invisibility )

- If you have a Strength of 13 or more, you can spend one of your attacks to make a Grapple check to restrain them. If you succeed, the creature is Restrained by you. If you fail, the Grapple is broken and the creature can use its reaction to make an opportunity attack against you.

## Expanded Exhaustion
The Exhaustion condition covers all effects from casual exhaustion to life drain. These rules allow differentiation between normal fatigue and more dangerous effects.
Levels 1-3 of Exhaustion (called Soft) often happen with strenuous activity like working, training or fighting. Soft Exhaustion accumulates easily but is recovered quickly with a short or longer rest. Any rule or DM decision that makes you gain Soft Exhaustion increases your Exhaustion only if your current Exhaustion is level 2 or less.
Levels 4-6 of Exhaustion come in play when you push past your limits or your life is being drained. If you have 4 or more levels of Exhaustion, you may recover a level of Exhaustion only during long or full rest.

### Soft Exhaustion

|Level|Effect|
|---|---|
|1|Disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity Ability and Skill checks. You can't perform the Dash action during combat.|
|2|Disadvantage on all Ability and Skill checks. Speed halved and unable to maintain a fast travel pace. Anyone can tell you're tired with DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check.|
|3|Disadvantage on Attack rolls and Saving Throws and unable to maintain a normal travel pace. Rolling 1 on attack rolls leads to critical fumbles|

###### Excess Soft Exhaustion  
If you have reached the maximum level of Soft Exhaustion and you take another level of it, instead of increasing your Exhaustion level you lose one Recovery die. If you have no Recovery dice left, your Exhaustion increases as normal

### Heavy Exhaustion

|Level|Effect|
|---|---|
|4|You can only take an action or a bonus action during your turn, and you can't take reactions. You can concentrate on one thing only, such as a spell or enemy target, and ignore all the rest. You're limited to simple mental tasks.|
|5|Speed reduced to 5 and unable to maintain a slow travel pace. Anyone can tell you're on the verge of passing out. You cannot concentrate, or cast spells requiring Concentration. You have blurry vision, tunnel vision, or vertigo and may experience hallucinations (DM's choice).|
|6|You are Dying. You gain two wound levels. Any additional Exhaustion counts as two wound levels.|
