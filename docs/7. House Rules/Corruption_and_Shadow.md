IN THE Realm of Mists magic has a real and immediate price. Every creature has a shadow, an ethereal reflection of themselves. For most normal people, their shadow turns gray as their life, with its disappointments, turnings and sorrows, passes. But for those who wield magic or delve into the most dangerous places of sorrow and memory, the deadly darkness of true deep shadow awaits. The darkness can overcome you, driving you to madness and despair. But it is also the only path to power. What will you dare?

## SHADOW

Each living creature possesses a Shadow, an aura around them that can be seen by those with the talent to perceive such things. In the world of Symbaroum, no one possesses a singularly bright-white Shadow, instead most folk have a shifting pattern of muted colors and grayness, representing a hard life full of sacrifices and suffering. Those who would brave the forest of Davokar or serve the Queen boldly might have brighter, more vibrant and more complex Shadows, but for those heroes who choose to fight against the evil nature of the world, gaining Corruption is inevitable. As Corruption increases, a Shadow becomes darker, more twisted and tainted.

Natural beasts have green, red and white shadows or sometimes another bright primary color. Civilized creatures have gold, silver, copper or sometimes other metallic shades. Corrupted creatures have dark shadows: blight beasts or nearly-corrupt creatures are black and purple while less blight-stricken beings exhibit a slight change in their colors, like corroded copper, blackened silver, sickly green, red with streaks of rust or white with flakes of ashen gray.

#### Shadow and Alignment

The underlying theme of Ruins of Symbaroum is the struggle between nature and civilization, between creativity and discipline – and what happens when nature is cultivated (mainly by humanity); in this fantasy we imagine that nature lashes out in the form of Corruption, blightmarks, abominations and a darkening of the land. It is very much a matter of belief, action and feedback, but less about clear-cut good and evil. We do not think you need alignments to play in this world. You can of course use them, if you want to; it’s not incompatible, just not necessary for the world to make sense.

## CORRUPTION

Power corrupts, and in Ruins of Symbaroum this is quite literally true. A fundamental principle is that when nature is cultivated or violated it grows dark and vengeful – and strikes back! The darkness that comes alive in this way feeds off and can continue to infect its surroundings. Since Mystics bend and warp nature according to their will, they are constantly threatened by Corruption. This principle is mirrored in the concept of Shadows and in creatures like abominations and the undead.

Corruption starts at 0 and increases from there. Most Corruption gathered is temporary, your character struggles against a dark foe, or uses non-permanent magic and their Shadow temporarily grows darker. However, sometimes you will gain permanent Corruption, usually by taking up a powerful magical item or by exceeding your Corruption Threshold.

For non-Mystic characters, your Corruption Threshold is equal to the total of twice your proficiency bonus plus your Charisma modifier, as the influence of a darkening Shadow makes most people gloomy and morose. So the formula is:

Corruption Threshold = ([your proficiency bonus × 2] + your Charisma modifier), minimum 2.

During the course of the game, you will gain temporary Corruption. You might also start with a certain amount of permanent Corruption, due to your equipment or mishaps in the past. Your starting Corruption value can never be lower than your permanent Corruption score.

If your total Corruption (temporary plus permanent) exceeds your Corruption Threshold, you must make a Corruption check, to see if you can bear so much darkness. Roll a d20. If the result is equal to or less than the amount by which your current Corruption exceeds your Threshold, you will gain a mark of Corruption. Roll 1d20 on the Marks of Corruption table to the right. The mark fades 24 hours after your total Corruption drops below your Corruption Threshold.

Example: Mira’s ogre mystic Grumpa has been casting several spells in a desperate bid to escape some unwise hunters. Grumpa’s Corruption Threshold is 7 and Mira’s last casting brings her current Corruption to 10. 10 (current Corruption) minus 7 (Corruption threshold) equals 3. She rolls a d20 and if the result is 3 or lower, Grumpa will gain a mark of Corruption.

You only make a roll when you gain new Corruption and that new Corruption exceeds your Threshold. If you receive the same mark of Corruption twice then it can either intensify or your GM can choose another result for you.

### Corruption and Shadow

As you gain Corruption, your Shadow changes. Temporary Corruption darkens the Shadow, muting any color that it once possessed.

The category listing in the table below indicates how the theurgs of Prios would judge a person’s Shadow, based on their holy smoke ritual (see Holy Smoke ).

Permanent Corruption affects it in the following ways:
##### Corruption Categories

|PERMANENT CORRUPTION|CATEGORY|EFFECT|
|---|---|---|
|1 point or more|Blight-stricken|Visible to those who can see Shadows as black spots moving within the Shadow.|
|At half your Threshold or higher|Blight-marked|Your Shadow is covered with darkness, causing great concern for those who can see it.|
|Beyond your Threshold|Thoroughly Corrupt|Your Shadow becomes completely black and your character must become a NPC as you are overwhelmed by the burdens you bear.|
