# Exhausting Combat
At the end of a combat encounter each surviving participant makes a Constitution saving throw to avoid exhaustion. The DC for the saving throw is equal to 10 + the number of complete rounds that occurred during the encounter. On a failure, a creature suffers 1 level of soft exhaustion.
