# Ingenious Proficiency

Having a higher Intelligence means having more knowledge than other characters. During character creation, for each point of your Intelligence modifier above 0 you can choose a skill specialty chosen from lore skills (Arcana, History, Nature, Religion). If you are not proficient in any lore skills you either gain proficiency with a lore skill, choose an extra language known, or pick a tool proficiency in one artisan’s tool, gaming kit, instrument, or vehicle.

As long as your Intelligence modifier is above 0, it contributes to the things you know. At character creation, you can choose one of the following benefits for each point of your Intelligence modifier above 0:

- An extra language known.
- A tool proficiency in one artisan’s tool, gaming kit, instrument, or vehicle.
- A skill specialty in one of the following skills: Arcana, History, Nature, Religion.

When you permanently increase your Intelligence modifier, you may spend additional points as above.  
Proficiencies learned by spending points cannot be lost once gained.
