# Metagaming

Is when players use external knowledge to determine their character's actions,  particularly when said player character shouldn't know the information in question.  Like knowing the stats of a monster they have never encountered because they read the  Monster Manual seven times, then using that knowledge to decide on a course of action.  Another word for it is "Cheating".  
To be clear, I don't get hard-core about stomping out metagaming at the table,  especially with new players. Sometimes they need to metagame just to survive! And for experienced players, I'll just remind them that "Grog doesn't know that the flame skull has resistance to piercing damage," and I won't allow them to swap weapons at the start of combat. Veteran players need very little coaching, while min-maxers always do.

## My rule is pretty simple:

I remind players often what their character knows, and I'm careful to only allow them to act on the basis of that knowledge. No exceptions.

# Table-Talk

Is another form of metagaming, where players have a discussion about what to do, or anything else in the middle of a scenario. Table-talk breaks up the real time aspect of role playing and allows players time to make decisions their characters would not normally be able to make.

## My rule on Table-Talk is also pretty simple:

Everything is happening in real time. Everything they are saying is being said out loud! I only make exceptions for new players to clarify some rules. Players can call a timeout if they wish, but they can't confer on how to proceed during that timeout (it's a bathroom break). Whatever they say to each other can be heard by all the NPC's within earshot, who will now act accordingly. This includes joking around. I've had experienced players say some terrible things in jest in front of a Drow matriarch. They all died. Ending table-talk is essential to creating urgency and immediacy in your games and helping your players engage their imaginations.
