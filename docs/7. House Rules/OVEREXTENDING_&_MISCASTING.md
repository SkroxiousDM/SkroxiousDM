When a spellcaster attempts a spell he or she knows about that is of a level greater than the caster’s ability to cast, the caster can make a spellcasting ability check against a DC of 10 + the spell’s level. On a success, the spell is cast and the spellcaster suffers one level of exhaustion for each level the spell exceeds his or her normal maximum spell slot level. On a failure, the spell is miscast horribly in a manner determined by the DM.
