# Resting and Healing
## Hit Dice = Recovery Dice

## Rest
Resting in the oppressive, bleak land of Barovia is difficult. The following rule changes reflect this.
### Breather

Taking a breather is a short period of rest, at least 5 minutes long, after a strenuous activity. During that time you may rest, slake your thirst and hunger, or check on a single wound and bandage it. During a breather, you may spend one Recovery Die. If a Recovery Die is spent to heal, you roll the die and add your Constitution modifier to it. You regain Vigour  points equal to the total. You can spend a Recovery Die in order to reduce your temporary Corruption by your proficiency bonus.

### Short Rest

A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which you do nothing more strenuous than light activity like eating, drinking, reading, dozing, tending to wounds, and standing watch..
###### INTERRUPTING THE REST
 A Short Rest is stopped by the following interruptions:
- Rolling Initiative
- Casting a spell other than a cantrip
- Taking any damage
An interrupted Short Rest confers no benefits, and it must be started over to confer any.
- You can spend one or more Recovery Dice to recover vigor points, up to the character’s maximum number of Recovery Dice, which is equal to your level. For each Recovery Die spent in this way, you roll the die and add your Constitution modifier to it. You regain vigor points equal to the total. You can decide to spend an additional Recovery Die after each roll. You regain spent Recovery Dice upon finishing an extended rest, as explained below.
- You reduce your temporary Corruption by your proficiency bonus.
- You can spend a Recovery Die in order to reduce your temporary Corruption by your proficiency bonus again. You can continue to do this as long as you have Recovery Dice to spend and temporary Corruption to reduce.
-  If you have exactly 1 level of Exhaustion, you can remove that level.
You can't benefit from more than two short rest in a 24-hour period, and you must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.

### Long Rest
A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps for at least 6 hours and performs no more than 2 hours of light activity, such as reading, talking, eating, or standing watch.
###### INTERRUPTING THE REST
A Long Rest is stopped by the following interruptions:
- Rolling Initiative
- Casting a spell other than a cantrip
- Taking any damage
- 1 hour of walking or other physical exertion
If the rest was at least 1 hour long before the interruption, you gain the benefits of a Short Rest. You can resume a Long Rest immediately after an interruption. If you do so, the rest requires 1 additional hour to finish per interruption.
- During a long rest, you must consume at least 2 pints of water and a ration. If you consume at least one sustenance, food or water, you do not gain any exhaustion. If you consume both food and water, you can recover from a single level of Exhaustion with a DC 10 constitution check, restoring 1 extra level of Exhaustion for an Exceptional Success. Sleeping in Medium or Heavy armor prevents you from reducing your Exhaustion during rest.
- You recover vigor points equal to the maximum value of your Recovery Die (e.g. 8 for 1d8) plus your Constitution modifier. This does not count as using a Recovery Die.
- You reduce your temporary Corruption by twice your proficiency bonus.
At the end of a long rest you regain up to half of your total number of Recovery Dice, rounded down and you can spend any number of Recovery Dice in that order to recover vigor points. Any Recovery Dice above the maximum amount for your level must be spent, otherwise they are lost.
- You can spend one or more Recovery Dice to recover hit points, up to the character’s maximum number of Recovery Dice, which is equal to your level. For each Recovery Die spent in this way, you roll the die and add your Constitution modifier to it. You regain vigor points equal to the total. You can decide to spend an additional Recovery Die after each roll.
- You can spend a Recovery Die in order to reduce your temporary Corruption by your proficiency bonus again. You can continue to do this as long as you have Recovery Dice to spend and temporary Corruption to reduce.

You can't benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and you must have at least 1 vigor point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.

### Full Rest

A full rest is a period of downtime, at least 24 hours long, during which you sleep at least 6 hours, and perform light activity or nonstrenuous labor for up to 2 hours.

A full rest cannot be attempted while in the wilderness, while sleeping on dirt or stone, or while wearing Medium or Heavy armor. You must be in a safe location where you do not feel the need to keep watch or constantly be on guard.

- You must consume at least 1 rations and 4 pints of water (a waterskin) during your rest. If you do not consume water, you gain 1 level of Exhaustion. If you cannot consume food, you cannot recover Exhaustion during this day. If you can provide both, you lose 2 levels of Exhaustion and if you have exactly 1 level of Exhaustion after that, you lose it as well.
- At the end of a full rest, you recover all lost Vigor points and regain all spent Recovery Dice.
- at the end of a full rest you recover 1 Wound level.
- Your temporary Corruption becomes 0.
- A full rest also counts towards recovery for any serious Injuries. You must have at least 1 vigor point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.  
     

#### Exhaustion.

If a creature does not take a long rest within a 24-hour period, it suffers 1 level of soft exhaustion every 12 hours until it takes a long rest.

#### Nightmares

If a creature has less than 50 percent of its vigor points or any level of wounds before taking a long rest, it may suffer from nightmares. The creature must succeed a Wisdom saving throw or gain one random effect from the Nightmare table. This effect lasts until the creature’s next long rest. A creature that fails its saving throw also only gains half of the recovery dice  that would normally be restored during a long rest.

###### Nightmare Table

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|1d6|Nightmare|Effect|
|1|Horrid dreams of death|1 random long-term madness|
|2|Fear of failing|Initiative set to 1 for all encounters|
|3|Defeated by a monster|No critical successes on a natural 20|
|4|Scared of the dark|Disadvantage on Fear checks|
|5|Horrific vision|Disadvantage on Horror checks|
|6|Despair|1 random effect from the Despair table|

# Healing

In a realistic or historic setting, players must rely on healing kits and natural healing, with precious little magic available to them.

These rules introduce new uses to the healing kits.

### Healer's Kit

5 gp, 3 lbs. This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves

and splints. The kit has 10 uses.

With Healer's Kit you can use the First Aid, Long Rest Care and Stabilise actions.

### Herbalist's Kit

5 gp, 3 lbs. This kit contains a variety of instruments such as clippers, mortar and pestle, and pouches and vials used by herbalists to create remedies and potions. The kit has 10 uses.

Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make to identify and apply herbs. Also, proficiency with this kit is required to create antitoxin and any potion of healing.

With Herbalist's Kit you can use Treat Poison and Treat Disease actions, as well as the Long Rest Care.

You can refill one use of the Herbalist Kit with a Wisdom (Nature) check gathering herbs from their environment, with the DC value dependent on their availability.

### Surgeon's Kit

100 gp, 10 lbs. This kit contains scalpels, scissors and saws, grasping forceps, and vials of alcohol. You must be proficient in Medicine to use Surgeon's Kit. This kit lets you use the First Aid action and benefit from advantage to the Wisdom (Medicine) check. Also, you can attempt the Perform Surgery actions.

A Surgeons Kit can be reused when all uses are spent, and can be refilled with 10 uses for 40 gold.

# Healing Actions

## First Aid

By spending a use of Healer's or Surgeon's Kit, you attempt to tend to an injured person until full medical treatment or rest is possible.

Make a Wisdom (Medicine) check against DC equal to 8 + twice the Wound level of the treated creature. If you provide First Aid to yourself, you suffer disadvantage to the roll. On success, you remove one Wound level.

Once you attempt a First Aid on a creature, you cannot attempt again until the creature completes a long rest.

## Long Rest Care

By spending one use of Healer's or Herbalist's Kit, you can ease the suffering of one injured creature during its long rest. While spending Recovery Dice to recover vigor points during the long rest, the creature can choose one of the dice and change it to the maximum value of the die. Also, the creature benefits from an advantage to its next Constitution saving throw made during the long rest.

## Stabilise

By spending a use of Healer's Kit, you attempt to stabilize and return creature to life.

Attempt a Wisdom (Medicine) check against DC equal to 8 + twice the Wound level of the treated creature. If you succeed, the creature can make its death save with advantage. Critical Failure causes a level of Exhaustion.

A PC who is proficient in Medicine can try to stabilize someone who is dying without a Healer's Kit, but they will need to succeed on the medicine check.  
A PC who is proficient in Medicine with a Healer's Kit can stabilize a dying character without making a check.  
A PC who is not proficient in Medicine  will fail any attempt without a Healer's Kit and add a level of exhaustion.

## Treat Poison

By spending a use of Herbalist's Kit, you provide immediate assistance against the effect of poison. The creature gains resistance to the next damage it receives from the poison and can immediately repeat the saving throw against the effect of poison. You can also spend another use and make a Wisdom (Medicine) check against the Poison's DC. If you succeed, the creature gains advantage to its saving throw. You cannot Treat Poison again until the creature completes a long rest.

## Treat Disease

By spending a use of Herbalist's Kit, you provide relief from a disease and prevent is further spreading. The creature can immediately repeat the saving throw against the effect of disease.

You can also spend another use and make a Wisdom (Medicine) check against the Disease's DC. If you succeed, the creature gains advantage to its saving throw. In addition, any check against contracting the disease from the sick creature is made with advantage. You cannot Treat Disease again until the creature completes a long rest.

## Surgery

Surgery pits the skill of the surgeon against the life force of the patient. Surgeries are meant to be difficult, and many of them may require multiple consecutive attempts before the surgery is successful. Be careful, however, as the longer the surgery takes, the more unstable your patient may become...

Attempting surgery requires three things:

A Set of Surgeons' Tools. From catgut to clamps, from bandages to bone saws, surgeon's tools contain all the necessary equipment to attempt any surgery.

A Character Proficient in Medicine and Surgeons Tools. Surgery is a specialized skill and impossible to attempt by anyone untrained.

A Controlled Environment. This means a stable setting free of threats and distractions for the duration of the surgery. Ideally a dedicated room. At the least, a stable encampment.

Concentration. Surgery requires concentration, so the surgeon may not also concentrate on a spell at the same time as performing surgery.

### Initiating Surgery

Once the three requirements above are met, a character may initiate the skill challenge. Each round of the skill challenge takes place as follows:

Surgeons' Tools Check. The character attempting the surgery makes an surgeons' tools ability check (generally using either Dexterity or Intelligence) opposed by the DC of the surgery. Each attempt takes 30 minutes. If the character meets or exceeds the DC, the surgery is a success. If they fail to meet the DC, they have not yet succeeded and may be able to reattempt.

Max Vigor Point Damage. The character undergoing surgery takes damage to their maximum Vigor points equal to their class's Recovery die (for example, a Barbarian takes 1d12 of damage to their maximum Vigor points). If the DC is failed by 10 or more, the character undergoing surgery takes two Recovery dice worth of damage to their max Vigor points instead. This damage represents trauma to the body through surgery and loss of blood. It occurs whether or not the surgery was a success.

Decision to Continue. If the DC was not met, it increases (cumulatively) by 1. The surgeon may choose to either proceed with surgery and make another surgeons' tools ability check or abandon the surgery.

Dying Patients. If the character's maximum hit points are ever reduced to 0, they are dying. If the surgeon immediately abandons the surgery at this point they are stabilized and regain 1 to their max Vigor points. If the surgeon proceeds with the surgery, the character dies.

### Assisting with Surgery

Second Surgeon. A character may use the help action to assist with surgery only if they are also proficient in surgeons' tools. In this case, the surgeon rolls their surgeons' tools check with advantage.

Assessing the Patient. A character proficient in Wisdom (Medicine) may assist the surgeon by assessing the patient's condition. After max hit point damage is done, they may roll a Wisdom (Medicine) ability check:

##### Wisdom (Medicine)

|   |   |
|---|---|
|DC|Information Known|
|8|You know if the patient has 0 VP and is dying.|
|10|You know if the patient has 15 or less VP.|
|15|You know if the patient is above or below half their original maximum health|
|20|You know the patient's exact VP|

If the surgeon chooses to assess the patient, they make their next surgeons' tools ability check with disadvantage. Splitting their attention between the patient's vital signs and the surgery itself is distracting and they need their whole focus to do their best surgical work.

Other Ways to Help. Any spell, ability, or mechanic that gives advantage or a bonus to ability checks functions as normal, but only pertains to a single surgeons' tools check unless its duration extends beyond 30 minutes. These include bonuses gained from effects such as (but not limited to) Inspiration, Bardic Inspiration, Guidance, Enhance Ability, and the Lucky feat.

### Recovery

Damage to maximum Vigor points inflicted by surgery recovers at a rate of 1 class RD + the character's Constitution modifier per Full Rest. For example, a Barbarian with a Constitution score of 18 would recover 1d12 + 4 to their maximum Vigor points after a long rest. The Greater Restoration spell cures this damage to maximum Vigor points as usual.

### Finding a Surgeon

The adventuring party should be able to find surgeons in any major city with little trouble, though they may not be cheap. The average surgeon charges 500 gold for a surgery, and the most skilled surgeons charge up to double that (though for a higher success rate, it may be worth the money).

Finding a surgeon in a mid-sized town or smaller village is more difficult. There is a 50% chance an NPC proficient with surgeons' tools resides in any given mid-sized town, and only a 10% chance in a smaller village. Even if the party manages to find someone who knows their way around a scalpel, often these people are more used to treating injured farm animals than they are people.

## List of Common Surgeries

Below is a collection of standard surgeries that you are able to perform with a set of surgeons' tools. The specific surgery required for each different injury is listed in the treatment area of the Lingering Injuries Tables.

### General Surgery

General surgery is the most standard surgery and can be used for a wide variety of applications. Removing the broken tip of a weapon from inside someone, stitching back together a perforated bowel, or removing necrotic tissue so a wound can properly heal would all be considered General Surgery. General surgery has no additional rules or requirements unless they are listed in the treatment section of the injury.

### Save Sense Surgery

A Save Sense Surgery attempts to save one of the character's senses, such as vision or hearing. Reconstructing a slashed ear or neutralizing acid splashed into an eye are examples of injuries requiring a Save Sense Surgery.

Sensory structures are generally delicate and small, and as a result, all one is often able to do is repair the surrounding area, apply salves and bandages, and hope for the best. As a result, you may only ever make one surgeon's tool's ability check for a Save Sense Surgery. If it is not successful on the very first try, then the surgery was a failure.

After a Save Sense Surgery, characters must wait 1d4 days before they remove the bandages and dressings to see if the surgery was successful.

### Save Limb Surgery

A Save Limb Surgery is attempted when you want to reverse damage done to a limb or small appendage. Reattaching a severed limb, treating an immolated arm, or reconstructing a crushed leg are all examples of injuries requiring a Save Limb Surgery.

When a limb is missing, the surgeon is racing against the clock. Each hour that the limb is considered missing before the surgery begins increases the DC of the surgery by 1. A Gentle Repose or Feign Death spell cast on the limb eliminates this DC increase for their duration.

A limb recovering from this type of surgery is weaker than normal and takes a penalty similar to if the Resurrection spell had been cast on it: The limb takes a −4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks requiring its use.

Every time the character finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.

### Amputation

Sometimes a body part is beyond saving. Sometimes a character is bitten in the arm by a werewolf and wants to prevent lycanthropy by any means necessary. For those occasions, there is Amputation.

Amputation grants the missing condition to a body part.

Amputation's DC is always 10.

## Healing Potions and spells

Magical Healing taxes the reserves of the body for immediate gains in Vigor. When a Spell or potion would heal vigor points, expend a Recovery Die and heal Recovery Die + stated dice + Constitution bonus. E.g. a regular Healing Potion drunk by a first level fighter with 14 Constitution would spend a Recovery Die and heal d10 + 2d4 + 2.

If a character has no Recovery Dice left and receives some form of healing (e.g., [[cure wounds]]), he receives the healing as temporary vigor points, not normal ones.

- Higher-level or more powerful healing, such as heal, does not require expenditure or presence of Recovery Dice.
- Certain kinds of healing don’t require the rolling of dice, such as the paladin’s Lay on Hands feature. These are used without recovery dice.
- with magical healing after vigor is full. Each 15 points recovers 1 Wound level.
