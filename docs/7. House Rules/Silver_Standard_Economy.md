Players interested in Medieval life and alternative historical settings may find Dungeons & Dragons prices and treasure based on gold to be very generous. Playing poor characters that struggle in remote areas is also made impossible by the ease of attaining gold. To improve the level of realism in your game, you may want to switch to the Silver Standard instead.

The Silver Standard is a simple conversion of all official rulebook prices of nonmagical goods, weapons and armor from gold to silver. If a longsword costs 15gp in the Player's Handbook, it now costs 15sp; a 1sp club costs only 1cp. This makes silver the basis of your game economy and copper is now a meaningful exchange unit for small transactions. Any treasure in the form of gold and platinum is suddenly the stuff of legend and a life changing opportunity to become rich.

Players creating new characters don't need to convert while choosing their starting equipment. Once done, any remaining money is converted from silver to copper, and from gold to silver.

Depending on your setting, you may want to keep certain prices in gold. In settings with low magic, magical items are expensive and should retain their price in gold. In settings where knowledge and skill are highly valued, mercenaries might retain their hire price in gold. In settings with politics and merchants, all international trade is done in gold.

The standard coin throughout the East is the silver denarius, which is equivalent to 8 brass dupondii.. Twenty-five denarii are equal in value to a single gold aureus.

1 Aureus = 25 Denarii

1 Denarius = 8 Dupondii

Some eastern cities call their silver coins tertradrachmas or shekels. Throughout the Persian kingdom, the silver denarius is equal in value to the sigloi, while the aureus is equivalent to the Persian daric.
