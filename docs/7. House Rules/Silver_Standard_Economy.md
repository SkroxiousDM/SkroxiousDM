Players interested in Medieval life and alternative historical settings may find Dungeons & Dragons prices and treasure based on gold to be very generous. Playing poor characters that struggle in remote areas is also made impossible by the ease of attaining gold. To improve the level of realism in your game, you may want to switch to the Silver Standard instead.

The Silver Standard is a simple conversion of all official rulebook prices of nonmagical goods, weapons and armor from gold to silver. If a longsword costs 15gp in the Player's Handbook, it now costs 15sp; a 1sp club costs only 1cp. This makes silver the basis of your game economy and copper is now a meaningful exchange unit for small transactions. Any treasure in the form of gold and platinum is suddenly the stuff of legend and a life changing opportunity to become rich.

Players creating new characters don't need to convert while choosing their starting equipment. Once done, any remaining money is converted from silver to copper, and from gold to silver.

Depending on your setting, you may want to keep certain prices in gold. In settings with low magic, magical items are expensive and should retain their price in gold. In settings where knowledge and skill are highly valued, mercenaries might retain their hire price in gold. In settings with politics and merchants, all international trade is done in gold.

# Medjeval Money
Money is counted in three denominations: gold florins, silver groschen,and copper pfenniges. Because distribution of wealth and wages were so different, comparisons to modern currency are impossible. In general, florins are very valuable, but are used only in large transactions; groschen are fairly valuable and are in daily use; pfenniges are "small change," important only to the very poor. Conversion between denominations follows the classic medieval pattern of "a dozen and a gross," namely: 

| | | |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|12 pfenniges (pf)|=|1 groschen (gr)|
|20 groschen (gr)|=|1 florin (£1)|
|240 pfenniges (pf)|=|1 florin (£1)|
