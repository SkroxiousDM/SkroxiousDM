# Battleforms
Certain class features, and the fighting style Formfighting Practice, offer your choice of battleforms. You can’t choose a battleform more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

## Formfighting Practice
You may take this feat more than once. You’re practiced with the basics of battleforms. You gain the following benefits:

Once on each of your turns, you can draw or stow a weapon without using your object interaction.

You learn two battleforms. If you have previously taken this feat, you instead learn three additional battleforms.

You may choose your battleforms from the following options or roll on the table below to determine them randomly.

Each known form can be adopted on your turn by using your bonus action.

#### Aggressive Form – The Lion Springs
Until the start of your next turn, you gain a special reaction. When you would make a melee weapon attack, you can use this special reaction to grant advantage on the roll.

#### Avoidant Form – The Dove Takes Flight
Until the start of your next turn, you gain a special reaction. When a creature enters your reach or moves while within your reach, you can use this special reaction to leap to an unoccupied space you can see within 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks from that creature.

#### Bending Form – Twisting the Wind
Prerequisite: The ability to cast
As a part of adopting this form, if you took the Attack action, you can engage in Double‑ or Two‑Weapon Fighting.

#### Cautious Form – Parting the Silk
Until the start of your next turn, you treat terrain as one step better (from extreme to difficult or difficult to normal). Additionally, when a hostile creature makes a melee weapon attack against you, you can use your reaction to move to another space within 5 feet of that creature without provoking opportunity attacks, imposing disadvantage on the triggering roll.

#### Contentious Form – Cat Dances on the Wall
Until the start of your next turn, you gain a special reaction. When a creature makes a melee weapon attack against you and misses, you can use this special reaction to make an opportunity attack against that creature.

#### Controlling Form – Apple Blossoms in the Wind
As a part of adopting this form, if you took the Attack action and would be able to use your bonus action to make an unarmed strike, you can do so as a part of this bonus action.

Until the start of your next turn, when a creature enters your reach or moves while within your reach, you can use your reaction to attempt to shove the creature. On a success, you can choose to shove the target an additional 5 feet.

#### Coordinating Form – Stones Falling Down the Mountain
If you took the Attack action before adopting this form, you can direct one of your allies to strike a creature you hit with an attack. Choose a friendly creature you can see or hear you and is within 5 feet of the creature you hit with an attack. That creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack against the same creature.

#### Cyclone Form – The Cyclone Rages
As a part of adopting this form, if you took the Attack action, you can engage in Double‑ or Two‑Weapon Fighting.

Additionally, the first time you hit a Large or smaller creature within 5 feet of you with a weapon attack before the end of your next turn, you can force the target to make a Strength (Fortitude) or Dexterity (Reflex) saving throw (their choice; DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with the weapon). On a failed save, it is pushed back 5 feet, and you can immediately move into the space it just vacated without provoking opportunity attacks.

#### Defensive Form – Lizard in the Thornbush
Until the start of your next turn, you gain a special reaction. When a creature you can see would make a melee weapon attack against you, you can use this special reaction to impose disadvantage on the roll.

#### Fusillade Form – Shake Dew from the Branch
As a part of adopting this form, if you took the Attack action, you can engage in Double‑ or Two‑Weapon Fighting.

Additionally, until the end of your next turn, when making a ranged weapon attack while you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll.

#### Gestalt Form – Striking the Spark
Prerequisite: The ability to cast
As a part of adopting this form, if you took the Attack action, you can engage in Double‑ or Two‑Weapon Fighting.

Until the end of your next turn, when you use your action to cast an at‑will power that requires a weapon attack, it is considered taking the Attack action for you for the purposes of engaging in Double‑ or Two‑Weapon Fighting. All of the other rules of Double‑ and Two‑Weapon Fighting apply to you.

#### Hidden Form – Kissing the Adder
Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of one creature that you can see within 5 feet of you. On a success, you become invisible to that creature until the start of your next turn or until you attack, cast a power, or otherwise take a hostile action against it.

#### Implacable Form – Leopard’s Caress
Once before the start of your next turn, if you would have advantage on a melee weapon attack, you can choose to forgo the advantage. If you do so, you can make one melee weapon attack against the same target (no action required), also without advantage.

#### Intuitive Form – Emptiness
Prerequisite: The ability to cast
As a part of adopting this form, if you took the Attack action, you can engage in Double‑ or Two‑Weapon Fighting.

Until the end of your next turn, you can use your casting ability instead of Strength or Dexterity for the attack and damage rolls of your weapon attacks. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

#### Mobile Form – Kingfisher Circles the Pond
You immediately leap up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.

#### Overwhelming Form – Boar Rushes Down the Mountain
Once before the start of your next turn, when you would make a melee weapon attack, you can instead force the target to succeed on a Reflex saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with the weapon) or take the weapon’s normal damage as well as any other effects that would occur on a hit. Damage dealt in this way ignores armor DR. If you would have advantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has disadvantage on their saving throw, and if you would have disadvantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has advantage on their saving throw.

#### Resistive Form – Lion on the Hill
The first time you take damage from a weapon before the end of your next turn, that damage is reduced by half.

#### Supporting Form – The Viper Flicks Its Tongue
If there is a friendly creature within 15 feet of you, you can move up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. You must end this movement within 5 feet of the friendly creature.

#### Vicious Form – Plucking the Low‑Hanging Apple
Until the start of your next turn, your critical hit range with weapons increases by 1.

#### Whirlwind Form – Thistledown Floats on the Whirlwind
As a part of adopting this form, if you took the Attack action, you can engage in Double‑ or Two‑Weapon Fighting.

Each time you hit with an attack on this turn, you can move up to 5 feet without provoking opportunity attacks from the creature you hit.
