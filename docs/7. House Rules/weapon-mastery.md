Each weapon has a mastery property, which is usable only by a character who has a feature, such as Weapon Mastery, that unlocks the property for the character. The properties are defined below.

# Weapon Actions
In order to gain access to the weapon actions from a weapon, a creature must have weapon mastery in that weapon type and have it equipped in the main hand or both hands. Off-hand weapons do not grant weapon actions.

Each weapon action can be used once per rest.
