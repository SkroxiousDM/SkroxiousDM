Unlike attack rolls, which have critical hits and critical misses, saving throws don’t have critical successes or failures. Using this variant rule, you can allow critical successes and failures on saving throws.

## CRITICAL SUCCESS

When a creature rolls a 20 on their saving throw against an effect, they automatically succeed on the saving throw, even if the result of their save would not meet or exceed the save DC. Additionally, if they would suffer any effects on a successful save, such as half damage, they treat the effect’s damage as if it had rolled the minimum.

## CRITICAL FAILURE

When a creature rolls a 1 on their saving throw against an effect, they automatically fail the saving throw, even if the result of their save would meet or exceed the save DC. Additionally, if the effect would deal damage, they treat the effect’s damage as if it had rolled the maximum.

Or if it imposes a condition double the duration.
