No PC race grants darkvision. Only monsters can see naturally in the dark. Races that normally gain darkvision instead gain the following:

◆ You can see in dim light as if it were normal light. You never receive disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks due to darkness.

 The purpose of this rule is to make monsters with darkvision scarier and the infiltration of dark places more difficult.
