Group Checks - I don't really like how these are handled in 5E. I propose we go the route that The Angry GM proposes, which is that rather than have the whole group roll, the player with the highest relevant stat rolls for situations where the group succeeds if anyone succeeds (searching a room), and the player with the lowest relevant stat rolls for situations where the group fails if anyone fails (stealth). Everything else is handled as normal, advantage, disadvantage, etc. but now the party can work together to maximize the chances of getting the desired result by providing spells, Bardic Inspiration, and so on all to one person.
