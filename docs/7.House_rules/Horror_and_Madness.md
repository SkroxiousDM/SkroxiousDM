## The Descent Into Madness

Characters may begin their careers with certain quirks, eccentricities, or foibles but none can be said to be insane. That comes later. Each encounter with an undead horde, gargantuan wyrm, or overwhelmingly powerful aberration leaves its mark upon their psyche. Taken singly their heroic nature allows them to continue to live a life of adventure, fight the good fight, and maintain some semblance of normalcy. The indelible mark on their psyche, however, can never quite be removed.

## Fear

When a PC confronts threats, monsters, or situations they have no hope of overcoming, the DM can ask the player to make a Wisdom saving throw. A character who fails the save becomes frightened for 1 minute.

roll fear checks in the following situations:

- If the monster’s max hit points are greater than the party’s combined hit points
- If the monster can kill a single player with one blow or spell

The DC of the Wisdom saving throw for the examples above should be 10 plus the creature’s Challenge Rating.

## Despair

A melancholic atmosphere pervades Barovia, and creatures who spend an extended amount of time there may succumb to it. Creatures who experience one of the following situations must make a Despair check:

- Taking a long rest or short rest in an unsecured location
- Waking from a long rest after suffering the loss of a fellow party member
- Suffering a lingering injury
- Seeing a fellow party member suffer from long-term or indefinite madness
- Encountering a major setback

Creatures who face Despair must succeed a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by a random Despair effect on the Despair table below. If a creature is already suffering a Despair effect and fails the saving throw, the new despair effect replaces the old one.

After finishing a short rest, a creature can attempt to overcome Despair by making a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the Despair effect ends for that creature. Calm emotions, lesser restoration, and greater restoration also remove Despair. Other spells or potions found in Barovia may also remove despair.

#### Despair Table

|   |   |
|---|---|
|1d6|Effect|
|1–3|Apathy.  The character has disadvantage on death saving throws and on Intelligence checks for initiative and gains the following flaw: “I don’t believe I can make a difference to anyone or anything.”|
|4–5|Dread.  The character has disadvantage on all saving throws and gains the following flaw: “I am convinced that this place is going to kill me.”|
|6|Insane.  The character has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws that use Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma, and gains the following flaw: “I can’t tell what’s real anymore.”|

## Horror

When a character learns, sees, or experiences something horrific, the DM may call for a Horror check. The affected  characters must roll a Charisma saving throw to resist. A  character who fails the save gains rolls on the madness table. Any madness that a character develops is transient unless otherwise noted. A roll of a natural 1 is considered a fumble and always fails and the madness will be 1 step higher. A specific encounter and/or named NPC/ creature can only incite a single Horror check.

Horror does not imply a threat but rather a certain amount of revulsion, anguish, and repugnance. It could come from learning a terrible truth or witnessing an unfathomable scene that runs contrary to their beliefs or is altogether gruesome. Examples of when to roll a horror check include the following:

- Seeing a mangled body
- Seeing a creature devouring another human
- Learning something horrific
- Watching a fellow PC or NPC die a horrible death
- Exposure to magic
- Exposure to fiends, undead, or aberrant creatures
- Situations of extreme terror
- Confrontation with one’s own mortality
- Outside attempts to control your mind

### Forbidden Knowledge

Tomes and codices of unspeakable evil or unknowable truths have driven many sages to lunacy. The histories, spells, and rituals contained within such eldritch books as Iggwilv’s Demonomicon, the Necronomicon, and Nameless Cults attack the reader’s mind with each page read and truth learned.

DC = 8 + the level of the highest spell in the tome*

*If the tome does not contain spells the DC is 12 for a rare item, 14 for very rare, 16 for legendary, and 18 for an artifact

### Unspeakable Horrors

Aberrations and fiends by their very nature can crack the protective walls around a character’s mind. Creatures of either of these types may induce a Horror check at the DM’s discretion. The sight of a creature whose CR exceeds the character’s level by 3 or more always provokes a Horror check.

DC = 8 + [creature CR – the character’s level]

### Mind-Numbing Terror

The activation of the hindbrain due to extreme terror often causes an immediate effect on a character’s psyche. Few things incite that terror more than the sight of legions of undead razing everything in their path. An encounter in which the characters are outnumbered by at least 5 to 1 induces a Horror check.

DC = 8 + [Encounter CR* – the character’s level]*

*For a horde of creatures use this table to determine the CR of the encounter:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|CR of the Creatures in the Horde|Number of Creatures|Multiplier|
||1|x1|
||2|x1.5|
||3–6|x2|
||7–10|x2.5|
||11–14|x3|
||15+|x4|

The presence of an unholy greater undead has the same effect. The sight of an undead creature whose CR exceeds the character’s level by 3 or more provokes a Horror check.

DC = 8 + [creature CR – the character’s level]

The final way in which stark terror may affect the stability of the character’s mind is if a character fumbles (rolls a natural 1) on a check against a fear effect. If the character’s level is equal to or greater than the creature that generated the fear effect the DC is 8.

DC = 8 + [creature CR – the character’s level]

### Struggle for Dominance

The struggle for dominance between a sentient item and its owner may damage the wielder’s mind. If the wielder loses a Conflict between herself and her item, and the item possesses her, she should make a Horror check as the item overwhelms her mental defenses and forces her to act as it wishes.

DC = 12 + the item’s Charisma modifier

### Character Death

Any character that fails their death save and is subsequently brought back to life through whatever means are available to her allies automatically fumbles a Horror check as their soul is tormented in the mists.

## Madness

Unless otherwise noted any madness developed by a character is transient. If a character must roll on the Madness table while afflicted with a transient madness the subsequent insanity will be short-term. If a character is suffering from a short-term insanity and must roll on the Madness table the newly developed psychosis is long-term.

- Transient insanity will continue to affect the character until she has completed the encounter that caused the Sanity check. To quell the transient insanity the character need only find a quiet place and spend a few minutes reassuring herself. (Breather)
- Short-term insanity afflicts the character until she has spent a short rest garnering the support of her friends, regaining her nerve, and rebuilding her mental defenses.
- Long-term insanity persists until the character is able to spend downtime to address the condition. If you are not using downtime in your campaign, it is after she has finished the adventure or quest she’s on. She will need a week of rest and support to quell the madness that has her in its grasp. After that time has elapsed the long-term insanity is resolved.
- Indefinite insanity is permanent unless cured.

## Going Insane

The acute manifestation of the lunacy exhibited by the character should be thematically congruous with the situation that caused the initial Horror check. That said, the link between the symptoms and the situation causing the behavior may not be immediately obvious. This is an opportunity for the player and the DM to be creative and develop the character’s idiosyncrasies.

The tables provide a plethora of options for the DM and player to explore for characters that are experiencing transient, short-term, long-term, and/or indefinite insanity. When relevant the DM should roll or choose an entry from the appropriate table below.

## Short-Term/Transient Madness

The acute nature of these manifestations means the character can quickly shake them off. In the case of transient madness, a few moments out of combat is all that’s needed, and for short-term insanity the character can resolve the condition with a short rest.

## Long-Term/Indefinite Madness

The effects of long-term madness persist until a character is able to completely recover both mentally and physically from adventuring. A long-term condition ends after the character has had at least a weeks’ break from the stresses of adventuring.

The effects of indefinite madness are pervasive and cannot be cured except through exceptional intervention such as a wish spell or divine intervention. A character with a long-term and/ or indefinite madness should still be playable and can offer a great opportunity for role-playing. After each long rest the character must make a Sanity check to see if she is able to temporarily suppress the effects of her condition until her next long rest. If the check fails the character suffers the effects of her psychoses until her next long rest, when she is able to repeat her Sanity check. If the check is successful the psychosis is held at bay until the next long rest.

The initial DC for suppressing a long-term or indefinite madness is 10*. With each successful Sanity check it becomes harder to suppress her madness and the DC increases by 1 over the previous check, until the character’s condition manifests and the process starts over. For example, Mal’s experiences in the Underdark haunt him daily, or more precisely nightly. His particular form of indefinite madness manifests as night terrors. This morning he sets out for his next adventure and he checks to see if night terrors will affect him. He rolls a 7 and adds his Sanity modifier of +4 for a total of 11. He makes his check and is able to suppress the terrors. The next morning the DC is 11 and again he makes the check. By the third day the stress of the expedition is beginning to wear him down. The DC is now 12. He rolls a 6, adds his modifier and fails his check. During tonight’s long rest he suffers from night terrors.

If a character is unable to suppress their madness after a long rest it will manifest as a persistent effect and/or as an acute effect in times of stress. In those situations, the character may experience an acute attack of lunacy. Stressful encounters include combat situations and may include non-combat encounters such as negotiations or interrogations with NPCs at the DM’s discretion.

 * If a character is suffering from multiple forms of madness each instance is handled independently.

During a high-stress situation, the PC may attempt to control themselves for the duration of that encounter. This requires a DC 12 Charisma save, and the character should apply her Wisdom modifier to the check. If the character fails her check she suffers the Acute effect associated with her madness.

## Class Updates

Some adventuring classes are more resilient to the mental strains and stresses of encountering these potentially Sanity-breaking scenarios. The combination of faith and inner strength that clerics and paladins possess allows them to add their proficiency bonus to any Fear, Despair, and Horror checks.

The force of will of monks allows them to use their Stillness of Mind feature to end a transient/short-term madness. Monks may also use this feature to suppress the acute effects of a long-term/indefinite madness for one encounter. When a monk gains the Diamond Soul feature she may add her proficiency bonus to Fear, Despair, and Horror checks.

Warlocks are able to use the strength of their pact and unique perspective to add their proficiency modifier to Fear, Despair, and Horror checks.

# Cheat Sheet

Think about it this way:

- Horror is when they experience something horrific, something that is repulsive.
- Fear is the act of being frightened, scared, afraid.
- Despair is the loss of hope, that all is not well, things are going to get worse.

## Horror Checks

## Duration of Madness

Transient is until the end of the encounter, shortterm until the end of a short rest, long-term until the character takes a break from adventuring, and indefinite is until cured.

Short-term Madness: If a character fails a Horror check while afflicted with a transient madness the subsequent madness will be shortterm.

Long-term/Indefinite Madness: If a character is suffering from a short-term insanity and fails a Horror check the newly developed madness is long-term.

Suppressing Long-term/Indefinite madness: After each long rest the character may attempt to suppress the madness (DC = 10 + days since previous bout) until her next long rest.

## Causes of Sanity Checks

## Class-Specific Updates

Paladins, Clerics, and Warlocks are all able to add their proficiency bonus to Fear, Despair, and Horror checks. Monks may end a transient or short-term madness using the Stillness of Mind feature. Stillness of Mind can also suppress a long-term or indefinite madness for one encounter. The Diamond Soul Monk feature allows the monk to add her proficiency bonus to Fear, Despair, and Horror checks.
