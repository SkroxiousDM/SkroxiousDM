Unless you are a spellcaster, Intelligence can be one of the least useful scores in Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition. To remedy that, your cunning mind unlocks the potential to learn more skills and knowledge than others.

When creating a character, you gain a number of points equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 0).

##### Proficiency Costs
|Benefit|Cost|

|Additional Class or Background Skill proficiency|2|
|Gain Expertise for a Skill you are proficient in|3|
|Learn an additional language|1|
|Tool proficiency|1|
|Gain Expertise for a Tool you are proficient with|2|
|Proficiency with 3 Simple or 2 Martial weapons|1|

When you permanently increase your Intelligence modifier, you may spend additional points as normal.  
Proficiencies learned by spending points cannot be lost once gained.
