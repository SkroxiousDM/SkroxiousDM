Reaction speed is determined first-and-foremost by your thoughts—the faster you can think, the faster your brain can tell your body to act.

When rolling for initiative, do not add your Dexterity modifier—instead, add your Intelligence modifier. Break ties first with Dexterity, then Wisdom.

## Tactical Wit

If you are a War Wizard, your Tactical Wit class feature now grants a Dexterity bonus—not Intelligence.

This may also apply to other unique class features or item powers, so judge accordingly.
