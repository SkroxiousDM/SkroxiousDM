# Pushing a Roll
If you fail a skill or attribute roll, you can choose to push the roll, which means that you make another attempt. The new result applies, whatever it is. If you have a advantage or disadvantage, you must re-roll both dice. You can never push a natural 1. Whenever you push a roll, immediately after the re-roll, you suffer a Push Condition. This means that you get disadvantage on all rolls for skills based on a certain attribute, and rolls against the attribute in question. Each attribute is linked to a certain Push Condition. Thus, there are six different conditions:
- Cramps – Strength
- Sickly – Constitution
- Tired – Dexterity
- Angry – Intelligence
- Frazzled – Wisdom
- Dirty – Charisma

You decide which Push Condition you get from pushing a roll, with two important restrictions:

- You cannot choose a Push Condition you already have.
- You must be able to explain how the Push Condition results from the action you are trying to perform. The GM has the right to reject clearly unreasonable explanations.

Once you have all six Push Conditions, you may no longer push your rolls. In addition to their effects, Push Conditions provide inspiration for how to roleplay your character. Mark Push Conditions on your character sheet.

## Healing Push Conditions:
  You can recover from a Push Condition by resting – a Long rest heals a Push Condition of your choice, and an Extended rest removes all of them.
