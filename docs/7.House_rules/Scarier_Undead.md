• Undead are immune to Necrotic Damage. Necrotic damage heals undead by half the amount inflicted.
• Skeletons have resistance to piercing damage.
• Zombies have resistance to piercing and bludgeoning.
• Killing undead with normal weapons does not destroy them. After 24 hours, they will begin to regenerate at 1 hp/hour. They can be destroyed with magical weapons, radiant damage, by a good cleric or paladin enacting a short ritual that takes 10 minutes, or by 1 vial of holy water for each undead creature.
