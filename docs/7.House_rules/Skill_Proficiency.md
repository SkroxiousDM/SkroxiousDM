Certain ability checks can only be made by those with proficiency unless otherwise stated.

- Medicine – For all checks (except Healer’s Kits to stabilize, which can be used with a DC15 to stabilize a dying character. No check is required for someone with proficiency).
- Performance – With instruments, must be proficient with the instrument.
- Survival – If no party members have proficiency, then it’s not possible to establish a safe camp, light a fire in the rain, follow tracks, or navigate in unexplored territory.  Non-proficient characters can use Survival for very basic things like finding clean water, hunting, fishing, foraging, and making poor shelters.

## Skill Check Retries
When another player attempts a Skill check roll to gain new information (Perception, History, Arcana, etc.) from the DM and fails, you may attempt the same check only if you have a higher Skill modifier than theirs.

## Helping Others
When you use the Help action to aid another character in a task, you must have proficiency in that Skill.

# TIERS OF PROFICIENCY
In addition to the two tiers of proficiency present in the Player’s Handbook - proficiency and expertise - these rules introduces a new tier of proficiency: trained. Progressing from one tier to the next is not a given, however; if you’re proficient in a skill, and you gain that proficiency again from another source, you do not automatically gain expertise. Instead, in these instances, you can choose another proficiency of the same type, as discussed in Chapter 4 of the Player’s Handbook.
## TRAINED
Trained lets you add half your proficiency bonus. Certain features, such as the Jack of All Trades class feature, grant this tier of proficiency. A character can be trained in skills, tools, saving throws, and weapons.
When a character becomes proficient in a skill or tool, they can instead choose to become trained in two skills or two tools, respectively. If a feature or feat would grant expertise in a skill or tool in which you are trained, you would instead become proficient in the two skills or tools in which you became trained.
## PROFICIENT
Proficient lets you add your proficiency bonus. Proficiency can be obtained in skills, tools, saving throws, and weapons. It also grants you the bonuses outlined below in Skill Proficiency Bonuses below.
## EXPERTISE
Expertise lets you add twice your proficiency bonus. Expertise can be obtained in skills, tools, and saving throws.
