# Success and Failure
## Critical Success  
rolled a natural 20 on an attack see also [[Crueler_Critical_Hits]]

skill checks move up one level
for example an untrained DC 25 skill check with a +1 attribute modifier would normally be a Minor Failure, moving up one level turns it into a Success.

## Exceptional Success  
Any noncritical Attack Roll that beats AC by 10 or any Skill Roll that beats DC by 10 is called an Exceptional Success.  
- If your Attack is an Exceptional Success, you may reroll one weapon die before calculating the damage. If you do, you can choose between the two results.  
- If your Skill check is an Exceptional Success, The DM may give you advantage on one related follow-up skill check.  
## Success:  
You achieve your goal.  
## Minor Failure or Success at a Cost:  
You failed by 1, 2, 3, or 4. You can choose to succeed, but something bad also happens as a consequence.  
## Failure:  
You failed by 5 or more. Something bad happens—you take damage, lose a Recovery die, a Condition worsens, etc.  
## Critical Failure:  
You failed by 10 or more on a skill check, or rolled a natural 1 on an attack. It's all gone badly for you and you suffer a second consequence in addition to the normal failure effects—you take extra damage, lose a hit die, drop an item, etc.  
  
#### Fumble Chart  
|D6 |Effect|
| --- | --- |
|1 |***Prone*** The combatant slips and falls prone  
|2 |***Disarmed*** The combatant drops its weapon. If it is not holding a weapon, it drops any other item it’s holding in its hands. If it’s not holding any items, it becomes entangled (as result #3 below) instead.  
|3 |***Entangled*** The combatant gets caught up in foliage, furniture, curtains, or even its own backpack. The combatant is restrained for 1 round.  
|4 |***Vulnerable*** The combatant makes a tactical mistake and places itself in a vulnerable position. All attacks against it gain advantage until the beginning of its next turn.  
|5 |***Disoriented*** A random blow or moment of confusion effectively stuns the combatant for 1 round.  
|6 |***Blinded*** Whether from blood in its eyes or a helmet falling down over its face — perhaps even a bright light—the combatant is blinded for 1 round.

# Critical Saving Throws
Unlike attack rolls, which have critical hits and critical misses, saving throws don’t have critical successes or failures. Using this variant rule, you can allow critical successes and failures on saving throws.

## CRITICAL SUCCESS
When a creature rolls a 20 on their saving throw against an effect, they automatically succeed on the saving throw, even if the result of their save would not meet or exceed the save DC. Additionally, if they would suffer any effects on a successful save, such as half damage, they treat the effect’s damage as if it had rolled the minimum.

## CRITICAL FAILURE
When a creature rolls a 1 on their saving throw against an effect, they automatically fail the saving throw, even if the result of their save would meet or exceed the save DC. Additionally, if the effect would deal damage, they treat the effect’s damage as if it had rolled the maximum.
Or if it imposes a condition double the duration.
