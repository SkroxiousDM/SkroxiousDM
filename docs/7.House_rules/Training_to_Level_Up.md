• Every odd level requires down-time to train. So 3rd, 5th, 7th, etc.

• Beginning at 3rd level a PC must spend time training in order to get the full benefits of the level. They can roll for HP as normal, but all other class benefits must wait.

• Training = 1 day per level of study, meditation, research, and focus. It costs nothing but time. Meaning that to reach level 3, it will require three days of training. That can be broken up however they choose. 6 hours-per-day minimum must be devoted. It can be part of an extended rest.

• If a PC is in an area, such as a city or large town, where mentors, veterans, libraries, temples, colleges, or teachers exist, they can spend 100gp to reduce the training time by one day, with a base minimum of 3 days.
