•If you don't have swim speed, you have disadvantage on all attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws. In clear water, your opponents also have 1/2 cover within 30ft, 3/4 cover from 30 to 60ft, and are completely obscured, and have total cover beyond 60ft. Adjust these distances according to the clarity of the water.
•If you don't have a swim speed, the only ranged weapon that can be used underwater is a crossbow modified to fire underwater (+50gp), and the rules above apply.
•If you have a swim speed, you can attack normally with melee weapons, but the rules on cover still apply unless your eyes are specially made for underwater sight, such as a sahaugin or sea elf, or you have blindsight, sonar, or some other magical sight that applies.
•If you have a swim speed you can make ranged attacks with disadvantage with a crossbow (underwater version), spear or javelin.
• Any combatant wearing metal armor sinks at a rate of 30ft per round. In heavy armor, no swim check is possible. You must remove the armor to swim.
