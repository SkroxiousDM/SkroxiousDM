Wounds and Vigor are variant to hit points made popular in previous editions of Dungeons & Dragons. Vigor represents your combat fatigue and ability withstand pain, while Wounds are a measure of your physical integrity and actual damage.

## Vigor

Your stamina and ability to evade enemy attacks is your Vigor points. It's equal to your hit points. Anytime you take damage, subtract that amount from Vigor.  
#### Vigor = Hit Points

## Wounds

### Wound levels

The ﬁrst time you fall to 0 vigor points, you become Wounded. There are six levels of wounds, and they work in a similar way to Exhaustion ( p291 PH ). Each time you are reduced to 0 vigor points, you gain one level of wounds. These wound levels represent signiﬁcant injuries, like an arrow in your arm, a serious cut, or a club cracking your skull. The more wound levels you have, the more penalties you suﬀer. Consult the chart below for the eﬀects of wound levels.

#### WOUND LEVEL EFFECTS

|Level|Effect|
|---|---|
|1. Lightly wounded|Disadvantage on ability checks|
|2. Moderately wounded|Speed halved|
|3. Bloodied|Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws|
|4. Brutally wounded|Vitality point maximum halved|
|5. Broken|Speed reduced to 0|
|6. Dead|Dead|

The eﬀects of being Wounded stack, just like Exhaustion does. If you have 2 wound levels, you suﬀer disadvantage on physical Ability Checks and your speed is halved. The eﬀects of wound levels do not stack with exhaustion levels, however. A character with 2 wound levels and 2 exhaustion levels has their speed halved, not quartered.

  
You gain a Wound level when:

- you take damage and your current Vigor is 0.
- you take damage from a critical hit. Even if your Vigor is more than 0.
- you take damage while unconscious, stunned, paralyzed, incapacitated, or you take falling damage.
- you take damage during a surprise round. You can make a Dexterity or Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to 10 or half the damage, whichever is greater. If you fail the save, you take a wound level.

## Bleeding

For each Wound level gained since the beginning of the combat, you lose 1 Vigor point as bleeding damage.  
You can stop the bleeding during combat if you spend your action, use a charge from a healers kit, and make a Wisdom (Medicine) check at DC 10 + bleeding damage. When combat ends and heart rates slow, bleeding causes you to gain one Wound level every 10 minutes, without Injury roll.

## Nonlethal Damage to Wounds

Nonlethal damage that results in gain of Wound level doesn't provoke an Injury roll. The same rule applies to bleeding damage lost outside of combat.

## Acting at 0 Vigor

Continuing to ﬁght at 0 Vigor points is possible, but very dangerous. You can no longer count on stamina, luck, or reﬂexes to keep you from taking a fatal wound. When your Vigor reaches 0 you remain standing and conscious but you are reeling. You gain the Staggered condition:

- Staggered characters can move or take an action, but not both.
- Anytime you use your action while Staggered, make a DC 12 Constitution check. If you fail, you take one level of Soft Exhaustion.
- You cannot take bonus actions or reactions.
- Staggered characters cannot gain temporary hit points.
- Characters remain Staggered until they are restored to 1 hit point or higher.
- A character who takes any damage while at 0 vigor immediately gains 2 additional wound levels and must make a Constitution Saving Throw or fall unconscious. If the character falls unconscious, they are out of the fight. At the end of the battle, the PC makes a single death save. If the PC receives healing or treatment of some kind (binding wounds, etc), they gain advantage on the save. If the death save is failed, the PC dies. If successful, the adventurer survives but rolls on the Lingering Injuries table with Disadvantage. A natural 20 death save negates the injury roll. Without further healing, the PC awakens in 1d3 minutes with 1 vigour.

# Lingering Injuries

Any time one of your characters receives a wound level from any source (combat, traps, spell attacks, etc.) they roll 3d6 on the table that matches that damage type. If the wounding hit deals more than one type of damage, they roll on the on the table for the type that dealt the majority.

### Step By Step

1.Roll on the Lingering Injury Tables

The character receives a wound level. Allow them to roll 3d6 to determine the injury or affliction they'll receive.

2. Roll on the Anatomy Tables,

if needed Some options may have you roll on an Anatomy Table to determine the location of the injury or scar. The DM may always directly choose the location instead of rolling if it better fits the situation's narrative. If, by chance, you roll a situation that is physically impossible or simply doesn't make sense given the established narrative (one of your characters takes shrapnel to their left leg when it is already missing, for example), then there is no effect, and the character (luckily) escapes the situation without an injury.

3. Narrate the Injury and its Effects

The DM narrates the result of the injury and describes any of its mechanical effects to the player. You may need to consult information in the section that describes the nonfunctional and missing conditions.

4. Treatment

Some (though not all) injuries are treatable. Treatment allows characters to reduce the duration of injuries, or even potentially cure them altogether. Unless otherwise stated, any treatment that requires a Wisdom (Medicine) check takes one action. In general, it is assumed that each character will have one opportunity to attempt this Wisdom (Medicine) check. The DM may allow repeated attempts at a failed treatment check at their discretion, but after a success further treatment attempts are not allowed (to further decrease the injury’s duration).

Assume that all characters are aware of the information in the treatment section of the lingering injury charts and understand how to tend to these injuries. As long as a character has a Healer's Kit it is assumed they will have any equipment needed for a treatment that requires a Wisdom (Medicine) check.

Some more serious injuries will require surgery to treat. Surgery is a skill challenge described in Resting and Healing. Even if an injury has no treatment listed, the DM is welcome to work with the character to find a cure that works well within the campaign's narrative.

### Force Damage

3d6 Injury Description

3 Third Eye Blinded

Something vital, yet intangible within you falls deathly silent. You feel...disconnected. You lose the ability to communicate telepathically. All magical communication that specifically targets you fails (such as the Message, Sending, and Telepathic Bond spells). Your mind cannot be read or detected.

4 Pertinax Machina

Your spells struggle to take and always seem like they need a little something extra. Any spell with a material component cost requires double that cost to cast. If the spell consumes the components, double the cost in components are consumed.

5 Null Arcana

As the arcane energy strikes you, you feel something within you sputter and fizzle. You lose the ability to cast spells through any means (including class features, racial traits, or magical items) for 1d4 days.

6 Ligo Secare

You feel the abrupt and disconcerting recoil of a severed connection. You lose attunement to anything you are currently attuned to. You may not attune to anything for 1d4 days.

7 Wild Magic Feedback

An errant thread of magic comes loose, slipping away from you and causing havoc. The creature or source of the damage rolls on the Wild Magic Surge Table (PHB pg.104).

8 Wild Magic Surge

An errant thread of magic comes loose, slipping towards you and causing chaos. Roll on the Wild Magic Surge Table (PHB pg.104).

9 Null Scola

You can feel the magic pulse and resonate with the arcane residue that clings to you from the last spell you cast. There's a searing feeling deep in your mind. You lose the ability to cast spells from the same school of magic as the most recent spell you've cast for 1d4 days.

10 Mana Discharge

You feel an almost anticlimactic pop and then, nothing. All your spell slots are harmlessly expended. You may reprepare spells as usual after a long rest or as your class dictates.

11 Lingering Aura

Roll on the Scar Chart. Sometimes there are strange side effects when you deal with raw magical energy. This body part emits faint, misty whisps of arcane energy with the following color and faint magical aura (roll 1d4): 1) Orange, Conjuration, 2) Red, Evocation, 3) Blue, Abjuration, 4) Green, Transmutation.

12 Lingering Aura

14 Mana Syphon

You feel the energy suck away your arcane essence and are left with a lingering feeling of emptiness. Two of the highest level spell slots you have available to cast are harmless expended. You may reprepare these spell slots as usual after a long rest or as your class dictates.

15 Imbuant Artus

Roll on the Large Limb Table. When the arcane energy has been expelled and the pain recedes, you flex your limb and find some of that energy has decided to stick with you. Unarmed strikes and weapons wielded by this limb count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to non- magical attacks and damage.

16 Dessico Vis

Your magical equipment fizzles and starts to emit a high-pitch whine. You're pretty sure it's not supposed to do that... Choose one of your magical items that has charges at random and roll 1d4. That many charges are immediately expended (targets chosen at random, if necessary) and the item's maximum charges are permanently reduced by that amount (to a minimum of 1).

17 Anathema Magicka

You shake your head from the force of the arcane blow and, it's gone. The knowledge, that is, not your head. You lose the ability to cast your most recently cast spell permanently. You can never cast this spell again by any means (including class features, racial traits, or magical items). If your class allows you to replace spells on your spell list when leveling up, you may replace this spell normally.

18 En Vivo Reincarnem

You experience the feeling of something unlocking, something leaving, something returning, and then grinding bones, stretching muscles, and sliding viscera. When it's all over you're left gasping for breath, and you're different. You change race as if the Reincarnate spell had been cast on you.
