Wounds and Vigor are variant to hit points made popular in previous editions of Dungeons & Dragons. Vigor represents your combat fatigue and ability withstand pain, while Wounds are a measure of your physical integrity and actual damage.

## Vigor

Your stamina and ability to evade enemy attacks is your Vigor points. It's equal to your hit points. Anytime you take damage, subtract that amount from Vigor.  
This represents the expenditure of stamina, luck and reflexes to avoid a lethal blow
#### Vigor = Hit Points

## Wounds

### Wound levels

The ﬁrst time you fall to 0 vigor points, you become Wounded. There are six levels of wounds, and they work in a similar way to Exhaustion ( p291 PH ). Each time you are reduced to 0 vigor points, you gain one level of wounds. These wound levels represent signiﬁcant injuries, like an arrow in your arm, a serious cut, or a club cracking your skull. The more wound levels you have, the more penalties you suﬀer. Consult the chart below for the eﬀects of wound levels.

#### WOUND LEVEL EFFECTS

|Level|Effect|
|---|---|
|1. Lightly wounded|Disadvantage on ability checks|
|2. Moderately wounded|Speed halved|
|3. Bloodied|Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws|
|4. Brutally wounded|Vitality point maximum halved|
|5. Broken|Speed reduced to 0|
|6. Dead|Dead|

The eﬀects of being Wounded stack, just like Exhaustion does. If you have 2 wound levels, you suﬀer disadvantage on physical Ability Checks and your speed is halved. The eﬀects of wound levels do not stack with exhaustion levels, however. A character with 2 wound levels and 2 exhaustion levels has their speed halved, not quartered.

  
You gain a Wound level when:
- you take damage that reduces your Vigor to 0
- you take damage and your current Vigor is 0.
- you take damage from a critical hit. Even if your Vigor is more than 0.
- you take damage while unconscious, stunned, paralyzed, incapacitated, or you take falling damage.
- you take damage during a surprise round. You can make a Dexterity or Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to 10 or half the damage, whichever is greater. If you fail the save, you take a wound level.

## Bleeding

For each Wound level gained since the beginning of the combat, you lose 1 Vigor point as bleeding damage.  
You can stop the bleeding during combat if you spend your action, use a charge from a healers kit, and make a Wisdom (Medicine) check at DC 10 + bleeding damage. When combat ends and heart rates slow, bleeding causes you to gain one Wound level every 10 minutes, without Injury roll.

## Nonlethal Damage to Wounds

Nonlethal damage that results in gain of Wound level doesn't provoke an Injury roll. The same rule applies to bleeding damage lost outside of combat.

## Acting at 0 Vigor

Continuing to ﬁght at 0 Vigor points is possible, but very dangerous. You can no longer count on stamina, luck, or reﬂexes to keep you from taking a fatal wound. When your Vigor reaches 0 you remain standing and conscious but you are reeling. You gain the Staggered condition:

- Staggered characters can move or take an action, but not both.
- Anytime you use your action while Staggered, make a DC 12 Constitution check. If you fail, you take one level of Soft Exhaustion.
- You cannot take bonus actions or reactions.
- Staggered characters cannot gain temporary hit points.
- Characters remain Staggered until they are restored to 1 hit point or higher.
- A character who takes any damage while at 0 vigor immediately gains 2 additional wound levels and must make a Constitution Saving Throw or fall unconscious. If the character falls unconscious, they are out of the fight. At the end of the battle, the PC makes a single death save. If the PC receives healing or treatment of some kind (binding wounds, etc), they gain advantage on the save. If the death save is failed, the PC dies. If successful, the adventurer survives but rolls on the Lingering Injuries table with Disadvantage. A natural 20 death save negates the injury roll. Without further healing, the PC awakens in 1d3 minutes with 1 vigour.

# Lingering Injuries
Any time one of your characters receives a wound level from any source (combat, traps, spell attacks, etc.) they roll 3d6 on the table that matches that damage type. If the wounding hit deals more than one type of damage, they roll on the on the table for the type that dealt the majority.

### Step By Step
#### 1.Roll on the Lingering Injury Tables
The character receives a wound level. Allow them to roll 3d6 to determine the injury or affliction they'll receive.

#### 2. Roll on the Anatomy Tables,
if needed Some options may have you roll on an Anatomy Table to determine the location of the injury or scar. The DM may always directly choose the location instead of rolling if it better fits the situation's narrative. If, by chance, you roll a situation that is physically impossible or simply doesn't make sense given the established narrative (one of your characters takes shrapnel to their left leg when it is already missing, for example), then there is no effect, and the character (luckily) escapes the situation without an injury.

#### 3. Narrate the Injury and its Effects
The DM narrates the result of the injury and describes any of its mechanical effects to the player. You may need to consult information in the section that describes the nonfunctional and missing conditions.

#### 4. Treatment
Some (though not all) injuries are treatable. Treatment allows characters to reduce the duration of injuries, or even potentially cure them altogether. Unless otherwise stated, any treatment that requires a Wisdom (Medicine) check takes one action. In general, it is assumed that each character will have one opportunity to attempt this Wisdom (Medicine) check. The DM may allow repeated attempts at a failed treatment check at their discretion, but after a success further treatment attempts are not allowed (to further decrease the injury’s duration).

Assume that all characters are aware of the information in the treatment section of the lingering injury charts and understand how to tend to these injuries. As long as a character has a Healer's Kit it is assumed they will have any equipment needed for a treatment that requires a Wisdom (Medicine) check.

Some more serious injuries will require surgery to treat. Surgery is a skill challenge described in Resting and Healing. Even if an injury has no treatment listed, the DM is welcome to work with the character to find a cure that works well within the campaign's narrative.
