_Come, strangers, in to a tale of woe...

_You are but a small, frail handful of flickering lights set against great darkness. Many such embers have been consumed over the centuries but perhaps your tale will differ. Perhaps you have a unique destiny in store. It takes but a single strong spark to set the world on fire.  Are you that flickering mote of hope? Perhaps... Then again, perhaps not...

_Time will tell. Enter the land of Barovia. A land of greys and shadows where light struggles against eternal darkness.

# So You Want to Play Curse of Strahd: A Player's Primer on Enjoying the Game

Curse of Strahd is an exciting, tense, fast-paced adventure. It is a vivid exploration of classic gothic horror tropes and monsters, from werewolves to vampires, ghosts, and more. It is a true sandbox, providing players with the freedom to make their own choices and build the kind of adventure they enjoy. It is an unabashedly character-driven campaign, giving your player character an incredible chance to shine and make their mark on the story your group tells.

However, Curse of Strahd is also a brutal, stressful, and alienating experience. Your character will be trapped in a bleak, gothic land quite different from the world they know. The adventure contains several encounters and areas that will likely be far beyond your capabilities when you first encounter them. It does not provide routine or readily-available loot or magical items.

For a player who’s not expecting it, Curse of Strahd can suck. Really suck. Let me put it this way: if you want the freedom to engage in combat and exploration without worrying about the potential risks, this is very possibly not the campaign for you. Likewise, if you are potentially triggered by gruesome depictions of horror or psychologically disturbing relationships, or if you prefer a D&D campaign that features only victories or setbacks (rather than the potential for outright defeat), you might want to try a different module.

Now, if you’re still around, stick with me - because there are reasons to play this (excellent, engaging, incredibly memorable) campaign.

You should play Curse of Strahd if you:

- love gothic horror tropes and themes
- want to engage with a character-driven story that pushes you to develop relationships with multiple vivid NPCs and factions
- prefer roleplay, investigation, and relationship-building to combat or dungeon-delving
- enjoy setting your own goals and pursuing means of achieving them
- enjoy facing an active, powerful, and personally antagonizing villain
- want to participate in a tense, adrenaline-fueled experience that will create memories to last a lifetime

If, after reading this far, you think Curse of Strahd may be the campaign for you, awesome! You’re in for a fantastic time. With that said, here are a few protips to succeeding in the course of this campaign:

- Intrepid adventurers and sadistic murderhobos don’t last long in Barovia. Don’t tread from the beaten path unless you have good reason to, and don’t alienate or antagonize NPCs if you can avoid it. Make more friends than enemies. Don’t go searching for treasure, fortune, or fame - because you will probably die a horrible death.
- Remember that you are not your character, and invest real time in developing their thoughts, personality, and motivation. Externalize failure, and use setbacks or defeat as an opportunity to explore your character’s perspective and personal growth.
- Play smart. Many of the enemies in this adventure cannot be overcome easily in direct combat. Use guile, preparation, subterfuge, diplomacy, and research to achieve your goals.
- Spend time engaging with the other characters, even when not discussing plans, tactics, or objectives. Learn about their fears, their perspectives, and their experiences. Build meaningful relationships, not apathetic battle teams.
- Outside goals are hard (if not impossible) to achieve in Barovia. It's worth working with your DM to create a character driven to Barovia for some purpose that can only be fulfilled within its borders. Make sure to speak with your DM about how to shape your backstory into something that can be relevant in the world of Barovia.
- Try to remove yourself from the “XP and loot” model of progression in traditional campaigns and video games, and instead try to enjoy the narrative progression of winning allies, fulfilling objectives, and advancing the story of the campaign and player characters.
- Don't try to play an apathetic or evil player character unless you are 100% sure that you can pull it off while being a supportive team player and engaging the story like a normal PC. Seriously. You'll make this adventure a lot more difficult and unenjoyable for your DM, and you'll be cheating yourself out of a fun experience. You don't need to play a knight in shining armor, but you definitely shouldn't play a villain.
- Curse of Strahd, as-written, is full of disturbing and graphic content. If you are potentially triggered by elements of child abuse, murder, stalking, gaslighting, racism, torture, mind control, cannibalism, situations paralleling sexual assault, child death, references to stillbirth/miscarriage, abuse of those with disabilities or mental illness, animal cruelty, body horror, child abandonment, portrayals of alcoholism or drug abuse, potential incest, implied necrophilia, or suicide, speak with your DM about potentially working around or entirely avoiding these elements.

Oh - and don’t Google anything related to the campaign.

The Web, after all, is dark, and full of spoilers.

# Player’s Guide

This player’s guide serves to inform you about the campaign, set expectations, and clarify rules pertaining to the campaign. Please carefully review this guide. Rules related to D&D may be found online in the D&D Basic Rules. Your Dungeon Master may have additional rules and information beyond the scope of the Basic Rules and this guide, which you can discuss during session zero. Curse of Strahd and Legends of Barovia lean on the three pillars of RPGs: exploration, social encounters, and combat. Legends of Barovia delves into each of these pillars and more. To survive and succeed in Barovia, the PCs must learn about the history that has shaped the realm. The lore reveals NPC motives and clues about how to succeed in quests and eventually escape the Mists. Additional lore can be learned by finding letters, journals, and tomes. The unspoken power in Barovia is knowledge, and deciphering myths from truths will help the players successfully navigate the realm. 

## What Is Gothic Horror?

Gothic horror is about the terror within, not without. It shatters the illusion of humanity in a poignant way by holding a mirror up to us and saying: look at what we truly are, and look at what we pretend to be. Under that mask of civility, there is depravity. Under that thin veneer of society, there is wickedness. Under all the trappings of sophistication, are we not all predators or prey? Gothic horror shatters the lies we trick ourselves into believing and shows that we, not some distant entity, are and ever shall be the architects of our doom. The quest for perfection leads us to discover our own imperfection. Our quest for the divine leads us to believe we, ourselves, are gods. These are the themes that haunt stories of Gothic horror.

Gothic horror’s roots trace back to Horace Walpole’s 1764 book, The  Castle  of  Otranto.  Typically  centered  on  a  battle between  humanity  and  the  forces  of  evil,  gothic  horror features   bleak,   oppressive,   dark   landscapes   and,   often, stories of tragic romance. Other examples of classic gothic horror  include  Bram  Stoker’s Dracula,  Mary  Shelly’s Frankenstein, Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Raven,” and Charles Pierre Baudelaire’s poems (such as “Les Fleurs du mal”). Curse of Strahd and the Ravenloft setting is D&D’s version of  gothic  horror.  Characters  in  this  type  of  world  are  not fantastic  heroes  but  ordinary  adventurers  achieving  the extraordinary—that  is,  simply  surviving  and  overcoming their fears .In  essence,  the  player  character  (PC)  must  endure  their bleak  and  desperate  position  in  the  world.  The  odds  are against  them,  and  evil  and  dangers  surrounding  them  are not   only   inescapable   but   unfathomable,   fueling   fear, horror, dread, and possibly even madness and insanity. Gothic  realms  are  full  of  decay,  dead  trees,  corpses, skeletons, and decrepit areas. Villagers are usually locked in their homes, and only those willing to risk death wander the open  road.  Despair  is  common  among  villagers,  who  have no hope of escape. Apathy born of the oppressive weight of fear.

## Extraordinary Adventurer

In   Legends   of   Barovia, your character   is   an ordinary adventurer that  can achieve the extraordinary—but  they have to earn it. No one becomes a hero in Barovia until they prove their merit. Barovia is a  unique place, and your character will  be out of  their  element.  At  least  initially, they will not be seen  as heroes   and   will   be   treated accordingly. This   serves   to reinforce  the  shock  your  character may  experience  when they  first  face  the darkness and  horrors  that  plague  this realm. Depression,  fear,  and  darkness  cover  the  land.  Talk  is cheap, and  only  results that  are  hard won through brave deeds are valued.  Dozens if not hundreds have ventured into this  realm,  all  believing they  would  be the triumphant heroes to save this dark place. None have succeeded. 

### Warning

> Legends of Barovia and Curse of Strahd is gothic horror, and some subject matter may be unsuitable or offensive to some players. This campaign is for ages 18+ and contains child abuse and neglect, emotional and physical abuse, murder and attempted murder, kidnapping, stalking, assault, gaslighting, abuse of power, racism, xenophobia, cruelty, torture, references to genocide, mutilation, mind control, the desecration of the dead and places of worship, cannibalism, mercy killing, parental death, child death, mental illness, starvation, cruelty to animals, prolonged and painful deaths, body horror, insects and infestation horror, decay, betrayal, consumption of alcohol and drugs, involuntary homicide, graphic depictions of death and violence, necrophilia, self-harm, suicide, and potentially other mature themes. If you find any of this material objectionable, offensive, or potentially disturbing, please inform the Dungeon Master to adjust the campaign and determine what is suitable.

### Pause for a Second

In addition to the safety tools implemented by your DM, at any time you may say, “pause for a second” to discuss the current situation out of character, including stating “I am not comfortable with where this is going.” All players should be respectful if a player invokes“ pause for a second.”

### Gothic Atmosphere

The realm of Barovia is foreboding, dark, odd, and unsafe. The PCs are adventurers in a foreign land that, at times, will outmatch them. Victory will be hard won, and defeat, even death, is an option. Yet for all Barovia’s darkness, there is light and hope. The characters’ goal is to restore beauty and splendor to Barovia, which it has not seen in almost four hundred years.

### Combat Encounters

Combat encounters may not be balanced. To provide a gothic horror feel, some encounters may be easy and others extremely hard. Retreat is an option. Sometimes retreating to fight another day is better than pressing on.  Analyze the situation and determine the best course of action. You will not win every encounter and sometimes could face deadly situations or suffer serious injuries.

### Social Encounters

Legends of Barovia leans into to roleplaying pillar of D&D. NPCs are not just quest givers or shopkeepers—they bring the world to life. Remember the following:

- Barovians are fearful and untrusting. They may whisper or tell only part of what they know.
- Some know valuable secrets, listen carefully.
- Rumors, myths, and lore is often told in different ways.

### Setbacks

Your character will face difficulty, even disappointment. However, what does not destroy those in Barovia, makes one stronger. Setbacks make victory all the sweeter.

### Lore

Lore matters in Legends of Barovia. Not only does it provide context, but it also offers clues and important information. NPCs may share history, myths, and lore with you, filling in the gaps and creating a rich world and experience. Books, journals, and letters found throughout Barovia serve a similar purpose. Libraries, homes, and bookstores are great places to find books with valuable information.

### Mystery

Everything is connected, and there is always something deeper to learn. Not everyone should be trusted, and not everyone tells the truth. Some enemies may become strange bedfellows, so don’t judge a book by its cover!

### Sacrifice

There may be times when your character must make a choice that results in unsavory consequences and sacrifices. Which road to take? Is there enough time? Is the reward worth the risk? In Legends of Barovia, your choices matter.

### Humor

Humor, even dark humor, provides a sense of comfort and safety in the most desperate situations. Laughter is often the best medicine. Don’t be afraid to laugh.

### Romantic Tragedy

Legends of Barovia is a world of romantic tragedy. Even in the land of darkness love, desire, and passion yearns even in the darkest souls. Yet there is hope, and that is what your character brings to Barovia—hope to end the dark romantic tragedy and bring forth a renaissance.

### Sanity

The realm of Barovia is like no other. Your character has never seen nor faced such a realm. They will face fear, horror, despair, and even madness. Managing your sanity is one of the important factors in surviving and succeeding in Barovia. While Legendsof Barovia includes mechanics to address character sanity, roleplaying the various mental afflictions plaguing your character further enhances the play experience.
