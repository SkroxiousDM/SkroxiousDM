Hunter (Monster Hunter)
Motivation: Duty - A player seeking duty begins the campaign with a raven's feather, a small, black feather with soft, downy barbs. When held aloft before a storm, the feather seems to gently tremble, exuding the scent of cold rain and damp earth.
The player who possesses the raven's feather should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that the feather will always guide them to those who need aid, protection, and comfort.
Internal Trouble: Anger  - I must learn to let go of my need for revenge.
Conflict: Forgiveness - Someone once did me great harm. It was only much later that I learned to forgive them.
Inspiration: Geralt of Rivia and Aragorn
