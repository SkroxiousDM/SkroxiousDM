### Session 5
The nerve of him. How could Ismark do this without even consulting me. It’s not him the devil has bitten not once but twice! But he’s right, this is the only way. And at least if I’m in Vallaki I can help those Barovians who have fled there. How many made it? I dare not let my mind wander as to what those poor souls endured on the road.  

Father is buried. And Doru is not lost. I have faith in him. If he can keep the monster within at bay, then perhaps hope does exist in this land. I wasn’t sure I could trust the visitors beyond the mists but after hearing of them giving Doru the chance to prove himself, the humanity in a world with so little... perhaps these visitors are trustworthy after all. Time will tell, Strahd has so many spies. I wish I knew what he wanted with me. Why is he obsessed with me? That bastard can’t have me. I will do what I must. As father did. Oh father I wish you were here. If not for me, then for Ismark. I fear he bears too much. Perhaps all leaders do regardless of their circumstances.  

We depart this afternoon, but first I will go to Lugdanna’s Knoll and retrieve the box Mother and I buried all those years ago. I care only for the memories we made together. That ancient bracelet I was holding when Father found me, perhaps I can bargain for it on the journey.  Maybe someone in Vallaki will know who Tatyana is. I’ve spent enough of my time in this life wondering who I am with no answers and now pursued by the devil himself. Well today is the day that I take matters into my own hands. I’ll help my people and in doing so maybe I’ll finally receive the answers I need.  
I’m glad to at least have the company of these visitors. The thought of doing this alone... impossible. It is strange, so many Barovians dream of the land beyond the mists, but these men and dwarf bear scars seen and not that would bring many to their knees. Still, at least they know the warmth of the sun. Sometimes in my dreams the sun is shining, and it feels so real.  

Perhaps one day, the sun will return to Barovia.

### Session 6 2023-12-04
We made it to Tser Pool but not without incident and not without the graciousness of that devil. He knows no bounds and there is nothing he doesn’t see in this land. He knew so much about the visitors and they have only been here a day. His spies are everywhere, they need to be more careful. If not, we’ll end up like the poor Lansten Family and so many others. A whole family turned to zombies. I wept for them in the night as I have for all those lost since Strahd woke and took vengence upon Barovia. But their bodies no longer harbour their souls, their fight is over. We were able to send the zombie horde away and found a cache of weapons left by Rudolf Van Richten. I wonder what has become of him?  
It was after this, at the crossroads that Strahd appeared, like an apparition, coming from our very same destination, Tser Pool. He thinks himself a gentlemen as he grasps the lives of men in his palms and squeezes. The way he looks at me makes my skin crawl. I was surprised the visitors were able to hold themselves back from his insults. Especially Radmill. Strahd loaths all humans but it would seem he loaths the lives of dwarfs even more. Bogokom and Radmil did well to reason with Strahd though. He could have taken me right then and there. Is this all just some sick game to him?  
Poor Escher. Another soul lost to the darkness and forced to drive carriage for the devil. I was more than relieved when he finally departed but his game was not over. I don’t know what Radmill saw in that hanging man but his despair was intense. Perhaps the evil in this land is fraying these visitors more than I anticipated. I’ll keep an eye on them. Not all wounds bear visible scars and if left to fester can prove to be even more fatal than the bow or sword.

### Session 7 2023-12-11
Further up the road, we saved a Raven who was being attacked by an abomination of feather and stick. A living scarecrow. Virgil fought valiantly and Vix proved himself a capable sorcerer. Magic is rare among the people of Barovia, I am glad he is with us.  

We finally made it to Tser Pool only to learn of our cryptic fates. Madam Eva’s gifts are astounding but in true Vistani fashion, make almost no sense at all. Perhaps the path ahead will shed light on the fates of these mysterious visitors. Her words seemed to burn in my mind until I wrote them out.  

She warned of a spy approaching and when we left the tent Eliza and Arturi were waiting. I do not trust either of them but if we let on that we know they could be one of Strahd’s servants all could be lost. Strahd will learn that Madam Eva is working to destroy the darnkess that grips Barovia. There it is. Hope.

I’ve heard many tales about Vistani hospitality, and last night exceeded all expectations. The fire was a welcome reprieve after our first day on the road.  I am glad for the Game of Stories, to have learned more of my companions. I am convinced however that the land beyond the mists is no better than this. Hatred and greed know no boundaries. I can’t believe it was the Vistani themselves that saved Strahd hundreds of years ago and for it have been granted safe passage through his realm ever since! If only they had left him to die then perhaps none of this misery would have befallen Barovia. I had never quite heard the myth of the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind quite how Eliza described it. Madam Eva spoke of a holy symbol of great hope in her card reading. Perhaps after I have ensured my people’s protection in Barovia I will convince my companions to investigate Yester Hill.  

## 2nd day of Neyavr, 735 BC
### Session 8 2024-01-08
For the briefest of moments, with the cool fresh air and the sound of Tser Falls I almost forgot where I was. This land is beautiful. Sometimes I can almost feel what it must have been like before the mists. This time it was the decaying knight sworn to kill Strahd who pulled me from my dream. But at least I am not alone in my desire to rid Strahd from this world. Argynvostholt. Seek Sir Godfrey. West beyond Vallaki and then south at the ash-gray path.

I had seen that lake so many times before and never had I stepped foot on its shores until today. How could I have dreamt every detail of that lake? Was it a dream or a memory? Father found me in the woods, could it have been there? All my memories from then feel like the mists itself. And to be set upon by wolves and a werewolf just like my dream! 

There are few who travel the Slavich Woods and do not find themselves stalked by them and I am grateful for my companions. Despite severe injury to Bogokom and Dorian, we were able to defeat the wolves.  

We arrived at the walls of Vallaki soon after to the most terrible sight. My people living in tents outside the walls in squaller! How could the Baron allow such misery to be inflicted? I will not stand for this, he will hear my plea to let them in. They need food and shelter. Not scorn and dream pastries. What kind of Baron does this to innocents?

As we found the Blue Water Inn, it took everything I had not to break down in front of everyone. After paying for the rooms I took my leave and let the sorrow consume me.  Through the tears and my despair at having to hold so much grief, I realized that this is my path, there is no hiding from it. Not while Strahd curses this land and its people. I will do what must be done and one way or another, when the time comes I will remember all those we have lost and all that we endured, and I will grieve. But that time is not yet. 

I was relieved to return downstairs. Losing myself in healing my friends and listening to that odd man Rictavio’s stories.  Those Wachter boys seemed to despise the Baron. Time will tell if they can be trusted, but time is not on my side.

## 3rd day of Neyavr, 735 BC
### Session 9 2024-01-29
How could they just stand there and watch that poor woman get dragged away for what… Malicious Unhappiness? Perhaps these men are not who I thought they were. I should have walked straight up to the Baron instead of pleading with my companions to do something and when I finally realized they wouldn’t help I was too late, the Baron was on the move. Izek, what a terrible monster of a man and yet something seems almost familiar. Who is he and why will he not cease staring at me?

I sit here now in the pews of St. Andrals Church, the one place in this whole godforsaken place that was supposed to be safe only to learn in 4 days time, its protection will be lost should the bones of St. Andral not be returned.  

They are searching for clues now, at least they are not just standing by now. 

Dear Morninglord I pray they find the bones. You are lucky to have a follower as devout as Father Petrovich. His warmth and kindness has given me glimmer of hope. 

How did Blinsky create a doll that looks exactly like me? My stomach sank at the sight. Him and his toys instills within me a most disconcerting sense of unease. So many questions. This place was suppose to be a refuge and now it swirls in the same madness as everywhere else.
We must find those bones.

### Session 10 2024-02-05
That monster is no Baron. A child driven to tantrum more like it. Though I really did not expect more. I’m lucky to have not been thrown into the stocks, and had I said anymore perhaps I would have been. At least he allowed me to pass freely through the gates, that coin is better put to use amongst my people than going to his coffers.

Thank the Morninglord his dog Strazni wasn’t there while we met. I can’t stand the way he looks at me.  I am grateful to my companions for accompanying me, they know not what courage they provide to others just by their support.

I left them to seek out the bones after Milivoj confessed to stealing them for the coffin maker Henrik, but perhaps I should have stayed to support them. When I returned from visiting my friends outside, some were closer to death than living. Wounds sustained from an encounter with Volenta. It would seem the terrible stories I’ve heard of her are true. Of all Strahd’s brides, she is the perhaps the least I would wish to encounter.

They survived though, and the bones have been returned. St. Andrals is safe from the undead once again. I wish I could have helped heal Radmil, Virgil and Vix more when I returned but I was so tired.  The people of Barovia are wasting away beyond the gates, it is a miracle that they are even still alive. Wolves and Werewolves encircle them each night and their minds are snared with dream pastries each day.  They won’t survive much longer.

the library has nothing of use exept for a genealogical tome archiving births and deaths to Vallakian families: Ireena Strazni, the younger sister of Izek Strazni and the daughter of Grygori and Fatima Strazni. According to the records, however, Ireena Strazni died more than eighteen years ago at the age of four, with Grygori and Fatima dying shortly thereafter.

Met Sir Godfrey. Godfrey solemnly informs the players that, because he is bound to the will of his commander, Vladimir Horngaard, he can offer them no aid in their fight against Strahd. He can share, however, that the slumbering spirit of the silver dragon Argynvost—the deceased leader of their Order—has stirred in recent weeks, and that the dragon is seeking heroes willing to stand against Strahd, though Godfrey doesn't know for what purpose.<br>
Though Godfrey cannot hear the voice of Argynvost himself, he encourages the players to explore the mansion and seek out the clues left by the dragon’s spirit by speaking with the other ghosts of the mansion—though he warns them to avoid the audience hall of Commander Horngaard himself.<br>
Godfrey also warns the players to be wary of the cursed spirits that still haunt the mansion’s halls: soldiers who fell defending the mansion from Strahd’s armies long ago, and who have never ceased their fight against invaders<br>
