### Session 1 *2023-09-18*
By chance or perhaps fate Vix Bogs, Virgil Bauchamp and Radmil Silvervein were pulled from the stable you all desperately sought shelter within, led by Vix’s scarf through impenetrable mists into the manor of Elizabeth and Gustav Durst. Upon entering this seemingly abandoned place , blood flowed and foretold of your death at the hands of a terrible beast. The way out had been bricked over as soon as you entered and the windows impassable, thanks to grotesque thick fleshy tendrils.

After exploring the main level you ventured up to the second floor balcony where you dispatched an animated suite of black armor. From the main level below you heard the front door slam shut once again and headed back downstairs to investigate.

Bogokom and Dorian had been pulled into the house by Dorian’s Raven feather. Dorian found an invitation to a dinner party hundreds of years in the past. Introductions were made between and the party became one over a dinner which appeared to have been spread out for them in the abandoned kitchen. Was this to be their last meal?

Upon finishing you began a more concentrated search of the property and as you climbed the floors it became evident that you were sharing this space with a presence beyond your comprehension. Stuffed wolves which seemed to follow you. Books that foretold your death as your read your life’s story. A ghostly dance revealing a furious past. All pointing to an affair and an infant.

Confirmed by the ghost of the nursemaid Klara trapped in a mirror and bearing the gruesome wounds of her torture at the hands of Elizabeth Durst. Despair filling within her chocking cries as you held up her finger with tiny teeth marks , found beneath a crib and unknown runes.

Eager to help, Klara revealed a hidden door behind the mirror leading you up to the attic. You made the acquaintance of Rose and Thorn, Elizabeth and Gustav’s legitimate children whom had been locked in their room and forgotten by their mother, eventually starving to death.

### Session 2 *2023-10-02*
They agreed to help if you could take their bones from this horrible place and give them a proper burial. Rose then possessed Vix because he wore her father’s neck tie and Thorn possessed Bogokom who was the biggest. Rose then led you to the secret stairwell down to the crypts where all were empty save for the pulsating fleshly tendrils within Walters. After defeating a grick and nearly losing Dorian, Vix realized there was more to Rose than previously thought and the party returned to her room to vetch the spells contained within her diary. Realizing they had passed a secret door with a locked shaped exactly like an amber shard seen hanging from Elizabeth’s ghostly neck, you headed to the master bedroom where Rose had seen her mother talking to it.

Before entering, a ghostly shadow appeared behind the glass door filling Vix with the most intense dread he had ever felt and the deafening sounds of Rose screaming in his head. But as quickly as it appeared so to did it disappear. Upon entering you immediately noticed on the bed that a knife had been plunged into a pillow, the sheets stained by a pool of blood.

The Amber Shard was found with Elizabeth’s jewelry box alongside a letter and filled with grain. The letter revealed that to quell the beast, hold the shard aloft and speak the Beast’s name.

You then headed down to the study and unlocked the secret door using the amber shard. Behind it lie a boobytrapped chest filled with valuables which someone else paid their life to never grasp and a letter signed “Your dread lord and master, Strahd von Zarovich” The deed to the Durst Manor and a Windmill.

As the clock continued to chime closer and closer to midnight and your demise you headed back to the crypts. Passing the larder led to an encounter with 3 ghoul cultists whom you dispatched but not without taking your own licks and leaving Vix with an insatiable urge to drink blood. A short rest was needed to gather your nerves within this dreadful place. With minutes left until midnight you explored deeper into the crypts only to be attacked by the boneless flayed skin of Gustav Durst. And at its defeat, the midnight chime came. So to did a huge and grotesque mass of flesh. The beast awoken at last and death crazed to destroy you.

### Session 3 *2023-10-16*
As the battle ensued, it appeared that you were victorious when striking it down but the beast rose up once more. Desperation grew as the beast unleashed renewed fury. Virgil, face to face with it took a direct shot of its acid gore. In his stunned state while the rest of you fought on all his senses focused on the baby and its deafening cry lying at the centre of the mound of flesh. He cried out through his pain “Target the baby”.

As Vix kept yelling “Walter” hoping to quell the beast, Radmil, Dorian and Bogokom kept up their attack until finally Bogokom dealt the final blow with a perfect shot through the mass and mercifully killing the baby.

Having hardly caught your breath the ghost of Elizabeth Durst finally revealed herself screaming that you would never escape and she began to bring the house down on top of you. Dodging falling walls and debris as you climbed back up a secret trapdoor you narrowly escaped out the now open front door at the last moment. Behind you, a hole down to black abyss where the house once stood. Before you, a forest shrouded in mist.

Rose and Thorn agree to stand watch while you collapse into sleep and in the morning at Dorian’s suggestion, you bury the bones of Rose, Thorn and Walter Durst beneath a towering tree with a rope swing. Finally laid to rest, the ghosts wish you good luck and say goodbye. As they fade away you hear children laughing and a baby cooing.

You pass through huge gates with decapitated stone statues guarding the way and as you pass, the gates close and lock shut. Welcome to Barovia.

As you travel down the road, silhouettes in the mists appear and disappear. A hunched figure, an enormous avian shadow, a reptile soaring with batlike wings, dozens of tiny birdlike shadows following, a tall slender figure with feathered wings, a broad figure with the shadow of an axe held by a clawed swollen hand and finally a tall cloaked figure sitting atop a horse whose shadowed mane seems to ripple like flames. All disappearing into the mist leaving you in an eerie silence once more.
You find another path off the beaten path, perhaps too trodden and realize that the body you find is a man by the name of Dalvan who was desperately trying to escape but kept walking in circles until finally dying of exhaustion. Beneath a dagger stabbed into the tree above the corpse carved letters read

“The horseman rides. The seer spoke true.”

As you continue, the woods fall away revealing a gloomy valley. A village with a dark twisting castle looming over head lies before you.

You are greeted by a Raven once you enter the village and it leads you to The Blood on the Vine Tavern. Outside stands a statue of a warrior holding a sword aloft. The plaque reads “Ismark Antonovich The Great.” Inside Ismark “The Lesser” introduces himself as the Burgomaster of the village of Barovia.

As you await drinks a crazed and desperate woman enters and pleads with Ismark that Gertruda has left for the castle. Ismark agrees to organize a search party as soon as the next one returns.

Over drinks Ismark shares with you:

• You’ve entered the land of Barovia, a realm surrounded by deadly fog and ruled by Strahd von Zarovich, a powerful vampire who slumbered in Castle Ravenloft until recently.

• Outsiders are occasionally spirited into Barovia by the mists.

• The village of Barovia was recently decimated by a siege from Strahd's undead forces. While the undead were dispatched, the village suffered heavily, and many Barovians fled to Vallaki, a fortified town to the west. Many are still missing, and Ismark has h ad to dispatch several search parties across the nearby woods in search of survivors.

• Just over three months ago, Gertruda's betrothed, a man named Doru, led a revolt against Castle Ravenloft. Doru and the members of his mob never returned.

• Shortly thereafter, a dusk elf named Rahadin visited the village to deliver a warning: the Devil had awoken from his coffin, and the villagers of Barovia had ninety days to make peace with their gods. Some Barovians fled for Vallaki, but a majority chose to remain in Barovia and defend their homes.

• Two weeks ago, Strahd made good on his threat. A horde of undead came to lay siege on Barovia. The villagers fended them off for a week, but suffered dozens of casualties. The siege only ended when Ismark's father, Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich, perished in battle and the undead withdrew.

### Session 4 *2023-10-30*
The nerve of him. How could Ismark do this without even consulting me. It’s not him the devil has bitten not once but twice! But he’s right, this is the only way. And at least if I’m in Vallaki I can help those Barovians who have fled there. How many made it? I dare not let my mind wander as to what those poor souls endured on the road.  

Father is buried. And Doru is not lost. I have faith in him. If he can keep the monster within at bay, then perhaps hope does exist in this land. I wasn’t sure I could trust the visitors beyond the mists but after hearing of them giving Doru the chance to prove himself, the humanity in a world with so little... perhaps these visitors are trustworthy after all. Time will tell, Strahd has so many spies. I wish I knew what he wanted with me. Why is he obsessed with me? That bastard can’t have me. I will do what I must. As father did. Oh father I wish you were here. If not for me, then for Ismark. I fear he bears too much. Perhaps all leaders do regardless of their circumstances.  

We depart this afternoon, but first I will go to Lugdanna’s Knoll and retrieve the box Mother and I buried all those years ago. I care only for the memories we made together. That ancient bracelet I was holding when Father found me, perhaps I can bargain for it on the journey.  Maybe someone in Vallaki will know who Tatyana is. I’ve spent enough of my time in this life wondering who I am with no answers and now pursued by the devil himself. Well today is the day that I take matters into my own hands. I’ll help my people and in doing so maybe I’ll finally receive the answers I need.  
I’m glad to at least have the company of these visitors. The thought of doing this alone... impossible. It is strange, so many Barovians dream of the land beyond the mists, but these men and dwarf bear scars seen and not that would bring many to their knees. Still, at least they know the warmth of the sun. Sometimes in my dreams the sun is shining, and it feels so real.  

Perhaps one day, the sun will return to Barovia.

### Session 5 *2023-12-04*
We made it to Tser Pool but not without incident and not without the graciousness of that devil. He knows no bounds and there is nothing he doesn’t see in this land. He knew so much about the visitors and they have only been here a day. His spies are everywhere, they need to be more careful. If not, we’ll end up like the poor Lansten Family and so many others. A whole family turned to zombies. I wept for them in the night as I have for all those lost since Strahd woke and took vengence upon Barovia. But their bodies no longer harbour their souls, their fight is over. We were able to send the zombie horde away and found a cache of weapons left by Rudolf Van Richten. I wonder what has become of him?  
It was after this, at the crossroads that Strahd appeared, like an apparition, coming from our very same destination, Tser Pool. He thinks himself a gentlemen as he grasps the lives of men in his palms and squeezes. The way he looks at me makes my skin crawl. I was surprised the visitors were able to hold themselves back from his insults. Especially Radmill. Strahd loaths all humans but it would seem he loaths the lives of dwarfs even more. Bogokom and Radmil did well to reason with Strahd though. He could have taken me right then and there. Is this all just some sick game to him?  
Poor Escher. Another soul lost to the darkness and forced to drive carriage for the devil. I was more than relieved when he finally departed but his game was not over. I don’t know what Radmill saw in that hanging man but his despair was intense. Perhaps the evil in this land is fraying these visitors more than I anticipated. I’ll keep an eye on them. Not all wounds bear visible scars and if left to fester can prove to be even more fatal than the bow or sword.

### Session 6 *2023-12-11*
Further up the road, we saved a Raven who was being attacked by an abomination of feather and stick. A living scarecrow. Virgil fought valiantly and Vix proved himself a capable sorcerer. Magic is rare among the people of Barovia, I am glad he is with us.  

We finally made it to Tser Pool only to learn of our cryptic fates. Madam Eva’s gifts are astounding but in true Vistani fashion, make almost no sense at all. Perhaps the path ahead will shed light on the fates of these mysterious visitors. Her words seemed to burn in my mind until I wrote them out.  

She warned of a spy approaching and when we left the tent Eliza and Arturi were waiting. I do not trust either of them but if we let on that we know they could be one of Strahd’s servants all could be lost. Strahd will learn that Madam Eva is working to destroy the darnkess that grips Barovia. There it is. Hope.

I’ve heard many tales about Vistani hospitality, and last night exceeded all expectations. The fire was a welcome reprieve after our first day on the road.  I am glad for the Game of Stories, to have learned more of my companions. I am convinced however that the land beyond the mists is no better than this. Hatred and greed know no boundaries. I can’t believe it was the Vistani themselves that saved Strahd hundreds of years ago and for it have been granted safe passage through his realm ever since! If only they had left him to die then perhaps none of this misery would have befallen Barovia. I had never quite heard the myth of the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind quite how Eliza described it. Madam Eva spoke of a holy symbol of great hope in her card reading. Perhaps after I have ensured my people’s protection in Barovia I will convince my companions to investigate Yester Hill.  

## 2nd day of Neyavr, 735 BC
### Session 7 *2024-01-08*
For the briefest of moments, with the cool fresh air and the sound of Tser Falls I almost forgot where I was. This land is beautiful. Sometimes I can almost feel what it must have been like before the mists. This time it was the decaying knight sworn to kill Strahd who pulled me from my dream. But at least I am not alone in my desire to rid Strahd from this world. Argynvostholt. Seek Sir Godfrey. West beyond Vallaki and then south at the ash-gray path.

I had seen that lake so many times before and never had I stepped foot on its shores until today. How could I have dreamt every detail of that lake? Was it a dream or a memory? Father found me in the woods, could it have been there? All my memories from then feel like the mists itself. And to be set upon by wolves and a werewolf just like my dream! 

There are few who travel the Slavich Woods and do not find themselves stalked by them and I am grateful for my companions. Despite severe injury to Bogokom and Dorian, we were able to defeat the wolves.  

We arrived at the walls of Vallaki soon after to the most terrible sight. My people living in tents outside the walls in squaller! How could the Baron allow such misery to be inflicted? I will not stand for this, he will hear my plea to let them in. They need food and shelter. Not scorn and dream pastries. What kind of Baron does this to innocents?

### Session 8
As we found the Blue Water Inn, it took everything I had not to break down in front of everyone. After paying for the rooms I took my leave and let the sorrow consume me.  Through the tears and my despair at having to hold so much grief, I realized that this is my path, there is no hiding from it. Not while Strahd curses this land and its people. I will do what must be done and one way or another, when the time comes I will remember all those we have lost and all that we endured, and I will grieve. But that time is not yet. 

I was relieved to return downstairs. Losing myself in healing my friends and listening to that odd man Rictavio’s stories.  Those Wachter boys seemed to despise the Baron. Time will tell if they can be trusted, but time is not on my side.

## 3rd day of Neyavr, 735 BC
### Session 9 *2024-01-29*
How could they just stand there and watch that poor woman get dragged away for what… Malicious Unhappiness? Perhaps these men are not who I thought they were. I should have walked straight up to the Baron instead of pleading with my companions to do something and when I finally realized they wouldn’t help I was too late, the Baron was on the move. Izek, what a terrible monster of a man and yet something seems almost familiar. Who is he and why will he not cease staring at me?

I sit here now in the pews of St. Andrals Church, the one place in this whole godforsaken place that was supposed to be safe only to learn in 4 days time, its protection will be lost should the bones of St. Andral not be returned.  

They are searching for clues now, at least they are not just standing by now. 

Dear Morninglord I pray they find the bones. You are lucky to have a follower as devout as Father Petrovich. His warmth and kindness has given me glimmer of hope. 

How did Blinsky create a doll that looks exactly like me? My stomach sank at the sight. Him and his toys instills within me a most disconcerting sense of unease. So many questions. This place was suppose to be a refuge and now it swirls in the same madness as everywhere else.
We must find those bones.

### Session 10 2024-02-05
That monster is no Baron. A child driven to tantrum more like it. Though I really did not expect more. I’m lucky to have not been thrown into the stocks, and had I said anymore perhaps I would have been. At least he allowed me to pass freely through the gates, that coin is better put to use amongst my people than going to his coffers.

Thank the Morninglord his dog Strazni wasn’t there while we met. I can’t stand the way he looks at me.  I am grateful to my companions for accompanying me, they know not what courage they provide to others just by their support.

I left them to seek out the bones after Milivoj confessed to stealing them for the coffin maker Henrik, but perhaps I should have stayed to support them. When I returned from visiting my friends outside, some were closer to death than living. Wounds sustained from an encounter with Volenta. It would seem the terrible stories I’ve heard of her are true. Of all Strahd’s brides, she is the perhaps the least I would wish to encounter.

They survived though, and the bones have been returned. St. Andrals is safe from the undead once again. I wish I could have helped heal Radmil, Virgil and Vix more when I returned but I was so tired.  The people of Barovia are wasting away beyond the gates, it is a miracle that they are even still alive. Wolves and Werewolves encircle them each night and their minds are snared with dream pastries each day.  They won’t survive much longer.

the library has nothing of use exept for a genealogical tome archiving births and deaths to Vallakian families: Ireena Strazni, the younger sister of Izek Strazni and the daughter of Grygori and Fatima Strazni. According to the records, however, Ireena Strazni died more than eighteen years ago at the age of four, with Grygori and Fatima dying shortly thereafter.

### Session 33
traveled to Vallaki 
 After receiving an invitation to dine with Strahd on Neyavr 14—the last night before the new moon—you journey east to Castle Ravenloft. Along the way, you re-encounter:
 Arrigal, who directs you to locate a traitor in Strahd's court; 
Father Donavich and the vampire spawn Doru, who have journeyed to Vallaki to seek Doru's betrothed, Gertruda; 
and the skeletal rider, which leads you to a mysterious locket hidden away in the Svalich Woods.

Upon reaching the castle crossroads, you are met by Strahd's black carriage, which carries gifts and escorts you to the keep.  

### Session 34
At the castle, you are met by Rahadin and Strahd's third favored bride, Anastrasya Karelova, as well as Strahd's additional vampiric consorts: Escher (Strahd's most recent consort) and Sasha Ivliskova (Strahd's eldest bride, and the traitor Arrigal referred to).

As you partake in the festivities, you investigate Sasha's true loyalties while avoiding conflicts with Strahd's other brides. After dining with Strahd himself, you have an opportunity to interrogate Sasha regarding the castle's secrets—and learn that Strahd will be away from Castle Ravenloft the very next night.

Following a tour of the castle and a test of your capacity for violence, a freak lightning strike disables the castle drawbridge, forcing you all to stay in Castle Ravenloft overnight in the middle of a powerful storm.

### Session 35 *2025-05-
After ascending to your room, however, the ghost of Varushka, a former servant of Castle Ravenloft, spirits you away to a multi-layered nightmare, forcing you to confront Castle Ravenloft's bloody past—or never wake again . . .
