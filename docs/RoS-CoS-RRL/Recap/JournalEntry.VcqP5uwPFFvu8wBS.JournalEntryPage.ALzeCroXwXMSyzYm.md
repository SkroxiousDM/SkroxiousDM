# Session 3 pt. 1
As the battle ensued, it appeared that you were victorious when striking it down but the beast rose up once more. Desperation grew as the beast unleashed renewed fury. Virgil, face to face with it took a direct shot of its acid gore. In his stunned state while the rest of you fought on all his senses focused on the baby and its deafening cry lying at the centre of the mound of flesh. He cried out through his pain “Target the baby”.

As Vix kept yelling “Walter” hoping to quell the beast, Radmil, Dorian and Bogokom kept up their attack until finally Bogokom dealt the final blow with a perfect shot through the mass and mercifully killing the baby.

Having hardly caught your breath the ghost of Elizabeth Durst finally revealed herself screaming that you would never escape and she began to bring the house down on top of you. Dodging falling walls and debris as you climbed back up a secret trapdoor you narrowly escaped out the now open front door at the last moment. Behind you, a hole down to black abyss where the house once stood. Before you, a forest shrouded in mist.

Rose and Thorn agree to stand watch while you collapse into sleep and in the morning at Dorian’s suggestion, you bury the bones of Rose, Thorn and Walter Durst beneath a towering tree with a rope swing. Finally laid to rest, the ghosts wish you good luck and say goodbye. As they fade away you hear children laughing and a baby cooing.

You pass through huge gates with decapitated stone statues guarding the way and as you pass, the gates close and lock shut. Welcome to Barovia.

As you travel down the road, silhouettes in the mists appear and disappear. A hunched figure, an enormous avian shadow, a reptile soaring with batlike wings, dozens of tiny birdlike shadows following, a tall slender figure with feathered wings, a broad figure with the shadow of an axe held by a clawed swollen hand and finally a tall cloaked figure sitting atop a horse whose shadowed mane seems to ripple like flames. All disappearing into the mist leaving you in an eerie silence once more.
