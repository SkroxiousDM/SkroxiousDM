# Session 10
That monster is no Baron. A child driven to tantrum more like it. Though I really did not expect more. I’m lucky to have not been thrown into the stocks, and had I said anymore perhaps I would have been.

Thank the Morninglord his dog Strazni wasn’t there while we met. I can’t stand the way he looks at me.  I am grateful to my companions for accompanying me, they know not what courage they provide to others just by their support.

I left them to seek out the bones after Milivoj confessed to stealing them for the coffin maker Henrik, but perhaps I should have stayed to support them. When I returned from visiting my friends outside, some were closer to death than living. Wounds sustained from an encounter with Volenta. It would seem the terrible stories I’ve heard of her are true. Of all Strahd’s brides, she is the perhaps the least I would wish to encounter.

They survived though, and the bones have been returned. St. Andrals is safe from the undead once again. I wish I could have helped heal Radmil, Virgil and Vix more when I returned but I was so tired.  The people of Barovia are wasting away beyond the gates, it is a miracle that they are even still alive. Wolves and Werewolves encircle them each night and Morgantha snares them with dream pastries each day.  They won’t survive much longer.
