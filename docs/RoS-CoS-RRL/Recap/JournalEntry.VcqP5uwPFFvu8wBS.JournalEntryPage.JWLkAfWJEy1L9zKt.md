# Session 3 pt. 2
You find another path off the beaten path, perhaps too trodden and realize that the body you find is a man by the name of Dalvan who was desperately trying to escape but kept walking in circles until finally dying of exhaustion. Beneath a dagger stabbed into the tree above the corpse carved letters read

“The horseman rides. The seer spoke true.”

As you continue, the woods fall away revealing a gloomy valley. A village with a dark twisting castle looming over head lies before you.

You are greeted by a Raven once you enter the village and it leads you to The Blood on the Vine Tavern. Outside stands a statue of a warrior holding a sword aloft. The plaque reads “Ismark Antonovich The Great.” Inside Ismark “The Lesser” introduces himself as the Burgomaster of the village of Barovia.

As you await drinks a crazed and desperate woman enters and pleads with Ismark that Gertruda has left for the castle. Ismark agrees to organize a search party as soon as the next one returns.

Over drinks Ismark shares with you:

• You’ve entered the land of Barovia, a realm surrounded by deadly fog and ruled by Strahd von Zarovich, a powerful vampire who slumbered in Castle Ravenloft until recently.

• Outsiders are occasionally spirited into Barovia by the mists.

• The village of Barovia was recently decimated by a siege from Strahd's undead forces. While the undead were dispatched, the village suffered heavily, and many Barovians fled to Vallaki, a fortified town to the west. Many are still missing, and Ismark has h ad to dispatch several search parties across the nearby woods in search of survivors.

• Just over three months ago, Gertruda's betrothed, a man named Doru, led a revolt against Castle Ravenloft. Doru and the members of his mob never returned.

• Shortly thereafter, a dusk elf named Rahadin visited the village to deliver a warning: the Devil had awoken from his coffin, and the villagers of Barovia had ninety days to make peace with their gods. Some Barovians fled for Vallaki, but a majority chose to remain in Barovia and defend their homes.

• Two weeks ago, Strahd made good on his threat. A horde of undead came to lay siege on Barovia. The villagers fended them off for a week, but suffered dozens of casualties. The siege only ended when Ismark's father, Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich, perished in battle and the undead withdrew.
