# Session 11
### 12 day of Fallrise

The party visited the Vistani encampment located a short distance away from Vallaki's walls. There, the players met the camp’s leaders: Luvash and Arrigal, Arabelle’s father and uncle, respectively.

The players learned that Arabelle has recently disappeared, Luvash asks them to retrieve a clue from the scene of her disappearance—a strange platinum signet ring—from Kasimir Velikov, one of the dusk elves whose hovels circle the encampment. Luvash believes that the ring may hold the key to finding his daughter, and promises the players a wealth of treasure if they research its secrets in the Baron’s personal library in Vallaki and uncover Arabelle’s location.

Upon obtaining the ring from Kasimir and returning to Vallaki, the players gained access to Baron Vargas Vallakovich’s personal library—by promising to investigate a haunting of the manor. Once inside, they soon met the Baron’s son, Victor Vallakovich, whose spellbook bears the same sigil as the signet ring.

In exchange for the players’ promise to bring back any relics found therein—including, if possible, a proper wizard’s staff—Victor told them that the sigil was the personal symbol of the archmage Khazan, whose abandoned tower sits on the shores of Lake Baratok. Though Victor doesn’t know how to get there, he directs the players to Szoldar Szoldarovich, a Vallakian wolf-hunter who knows the Svalich Woods well.
