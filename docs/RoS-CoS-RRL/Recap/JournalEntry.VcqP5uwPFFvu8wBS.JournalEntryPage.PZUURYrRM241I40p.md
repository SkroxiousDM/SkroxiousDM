# Session 9
##### 11th day of Fallrise

How could they just stand there and watch that poor woman get dragged away for what… Malicious Unhappiness? Perhaps these men are not who I thought they were. I should have walked straight up to the Baron instead of pleading with my companions to do something and when I finally realized they wouldn’t help I was too late, the Baron was on the move. Izek, what a terrible monster of a man and yet something seems almost familiar. Who is he and why will he not cease staring at me?

I sit here now in the pews of St. Andrals Church, the one place in this whole godforsaken place that was supposed to be safe only to learn in 4 days time, its protection will be lost should the bones of St. Andral not be returned.

They are searching for clues now, at least they are not just standing by now.

Dear Morninglord I pray they find the bones. You are lucky to have a follower as devout as Father Petrovich. His warmth and kindness has given me glimmer of hope.

How did Blinsky create a doll that looks exactly like me? My stomach sank at the sight. Him and his toys instills within me a most disconcerting sense of unease. So many questions. This place was suppose to be a refuge and now it swirls in the same madness as everywhere else. We must find those bones.
