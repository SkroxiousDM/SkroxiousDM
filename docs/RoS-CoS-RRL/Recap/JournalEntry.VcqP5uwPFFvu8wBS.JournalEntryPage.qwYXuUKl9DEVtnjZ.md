# Session 1 & 2 pt. 2
They agreed to help if you could take their bones from this horrible place and give them a proper burial. Rose then possessed Vix because he wore her father’s neck tie and Thorn possessed Bogokom who was the biggest. Rose then led you to the secret stairwell down to the crypts where all were empty save for the pulsating fleshly tendrils within Walters. After defeating a grick and nearly losing Dorian, Vix realized there was more to Rose than previously thought and the party returned to her room to vetch the spells contained within her diary. Realizing they had passed a secret door with a locked shaped exactly like an amber shard seen hanging from Elizabeth’s ghostly neck, you headed to the master bedroom where Rose had seen her mother talking to it.

Before entering, a ghostly shadow appeared behind the glass door filling Vix with the most intense dread he had ever felt and the deafening sounds of Rose screaming in his head. But as quickly as it appeared so to did it disappear. Upon entering you immediately noticed on the bed that a knife had been plunged into a pillow, the sheets stained by a pool of blood.

The Amber Shard was found with Elizabeth’s jewelry box alongside a letter and filled with grain. The letter revealed that to quell the beast, hold the shard aloft and speak the Beast’s name.

You then headed down to the study and unlocked the secret door using the amber shard. Behind it lie a boobytrapped chest filled with valuables which someone else paid their life to never grasp and a letter signed “Your dread lord and master, Strahd von Zarovich” The deed to the Durst Manor and a Windmill.

As the clock continued to chime closer and closer to midnight and your demise you headed back to the crypts. Passing the larder led to an encounter with 3 ghoul cultists whom you dispatched but not without taking your own licks and leaving Vix with an insatiable urge to drink blood. A short rest was needed to gather your nerves within this dreadful place. With minutes left until midnight you explored deeper into the crypts only to be attacked by the boneless flayed skin of Gustav Durst. And at its defeat, the midnight chime came. So to did a huge and grotesque mass of flesh. The beast awoken at last and death crazed to destroy you.
