# Session 1 & 2 pt. 1
By chance or perhaps fate Vix Bogs, Virgil Bauchamp and Radmil Silvervein were pulled from the stable you all desperately sought shelter within, led by Vix’s scarf through impenetrable mists into the manor of Elizabeth and Gustav Durst. Upon entering this seemingly abandoned place , blood flowed and foretold of your death at the hands of a terrible beast. The way out had been bricked over as soon as you entered and the windows impassable, thanks to grotesque thick fleshy tendrils.

After exploring the main level you ventured up to the second floor balcony where you dispatched an animated suite of black armor. From the main level below you heard the front door slam shut once again and headed back downstairs to investigate.

Bogokom and Dorian had been pulled into the house by Dorian’s Raven feather. Dorian found an invitation to a dinner party hundreds of years in the past. Introductions were made between and the party became one over a dinner which appeared to have been spread out for them in the abandoned kitchen. Was this to be their last meal?

Upon finishing you began a more concentrated search of the property and as you climbed the floors it became evident that you were sharing this space with a presence beyond your comprehension. Stuffed wolves which seemed to follow you. Books that foretold your death as your read your life’s story. A ghostly dance revealing a furious past. All pointing to an affair and an infant.

Confirmed by the ghost of the nursemaid Klara trapped in a mirror and bearing the gruesome wounds of her torture at the hands of Elizabeth Durst. Despair filling within her chocking cries as you held up her finger with tiny teeth marks , found beneath a crib and unknown runes.

Eager to help, Klara revealed a hidden door behind the mirror leading you up to the attic. You made the acquaintance of Rose and Thorn, Elizabeth and Gustav’s legitimate children whom had been locked in their room and forgotten by their mother, eventually starving to death.
