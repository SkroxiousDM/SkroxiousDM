# Session 4
##### Sunday 8th day of Fallrise, 735 BC  

 The nerve of him. How could Ismark do this without even consulting me. It’s not him the devil has bitten not once but twice! But he’s right, this is the only way. And at least if I’m in Vallaki I can help those Barovians who have fled there. How many made it? I dare not let my mind wander as to what those poor souls endured on the road.  

Father is buried. And Doru is not lost. I have faith in him. If he can keep the monster within at bay, then perhaps hope does exist in this land. I wasn’t sure I could trust the visitors beyond the mists but after hearing of them giving Doru the chance to prove himself, the humanity in a world with so little... perhaps these visitors are trustworthy after all. Time will tell, Strahd has so many spies. I wish I knew what he wanted with me. Why is he obsessed with me? That bastard can’t have me. I will do what I must. As father did. Oh father I wish you were here. If not for me, then for Ismark. I fear he bears too much. Perhaps all leaders do regardless of their circumstances.  

We depart this afternoon, but first I will go to Lugdanna’s Knoll and retrieve the box Mother and I buried all those years ago. I care only for the memories we made together. That ancient bracelet I was holding when Father found me, perhaps I can bargain for it on the journey.  Maybe someone in Vallaki will know who Tatyana is. I’ve spent enough of my time in this life wondering who I am with no answers and now pursued by the devil himself. Well today is the day that I take matters into my own hands. I’ll help my people and in doing so maybe I’ll finally receive the answers I need.  

I’m glad to at least have the company of these visitors. The thought of doing this alone... impossible. It is strange, so many Barovians dream of the land beyond the mists, but these men and dwarf bear scars seen and not that would bring many to their knees. Still, at least they know the warmth of the sun. Sometimes in my dreams the sun is shining, and it feels so real.    
   
Perhaps one day, the sun will return to Barovia.
