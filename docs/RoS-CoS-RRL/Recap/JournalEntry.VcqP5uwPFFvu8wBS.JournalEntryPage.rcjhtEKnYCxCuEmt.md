# Session 7
##### 10th day of Fallrise

For the briefest of moments, with the cool fresh air and the sound of Tser Falls I almost forgot where I was. This land is beautiful. Sometimes I can almost feel what it must have been like before the mists. This time it was the decaying knight sworn to kill Strahd who pulled me from my dream. But at least I am not alone in my desire to rid Strahd from this world. Argynvostholt. Seek Sir Godfrey. West beyond Vallaki and then south at the ash-gray path.

I had seen that lake so many times before and never had I stepped foot on its shores until today. How could I have dreamt every detail of that lake? Was it a dream or a memory? Father found me in the woods, could it have been there? All my memories from then feel like the mists itself. And to be set upon by wolves and a werewolf just like my dream!

There are few who travel the Slavich Woods and do not find themselves stalked by them and I am grateful for my companions. Despite severe injury to Bogokom and Dorian, we were able to defeat the wolves.

We arrived at the walls of Vallaki soon after to the most terrible sight. My people living in tents outside the walls in squaller! How could the Baron allow such misery to be inflicted? I will not stand for this, he will hear my plea to let them in. They need food and shelter. Not scorn and dream pastries. What kind of Baron does this to innocents?
