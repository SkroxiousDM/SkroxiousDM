# Session 8
As we found the Blue Water Inn, it took everything I had not to break down in front of everyone. After paying for the rooms I took my leave and let the sorrow consume me. Through the tears and my despair at having to hold so much grief, I realized that this is my path, there is no hiding from it. Not while Strahd curses this land and its people. I will do what must be done and one way or another, when the time comes I will remember all those we have lost and all that we endured, and I will grieve. But that time is not yet.

I was relieved to return downstairs. Losing myself in healing my friends and listening to that odd man Rictavioâ€™s stories. Those Wachter boys seemed to despise the Baron. Time will tell if they can be trusted, but time is not on my side.
