# Session 5
##### Moonday 9th day of Fallrise 

 We made it to Tser Pool but not without incident and not without the graciousness of that devil. He knows no bounds and there is nothing he doesn’t see in this land. He knew so much about the visitors and they have only been here a day. His spies are everywhere, they need to be more careful. If not, we’ll end up like the poor Lansten Family and so many others. A whole family turned to zombies. I wept for them in the night as I have for all those lost since Strahd woke and took vengence upon Barovia. But their bodies no longer harbour their souls, their fight is over. We were able to send the zombie horde away and found a cache of weapons left by Rudolf Van Richten. I wonder what has become of him?  

It was after this, at the crossroads that Strahd appeared, like an apparition, coming from our very same destination, Tser Pool. He thinks himself a gentlemen as he grasps the lives of men in his palms and squeezes. The way he looks at me makes my skin crawl. I was surprised the visitors were able to hold themselves back from his insults. Especially Radmill. Strahd loaths all humans but it would seem he loaths the lives of dwarfs even more. Bogokom and Radmil did well to reason with Strahd though. He could have taken me right then and there. Is this all just some sick game to him?  

Poor Escher. Another soul lost to the darkness and forced to drive carriage for the devil. I was more than relieved when he finally departed but his game was not over. I don’t know what Radmill saw in that hanging man but his despair was intense. Perhaps the evil in this land is fraying these visitors more than I anticipated. I’ll keep an eye on them. Not all wounds bear visible scars and if left to fester can prove to be even more fatal than the bow or sword.
