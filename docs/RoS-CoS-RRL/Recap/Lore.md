# History
## Ismark and Barovia
- The players have entered the land of Barovia, a realm surrounded by deadly fog and ruled by Strahd von Zarovich, a powerful vampire who slumbered in Castle Ravenloft until recently.
-Many outsiders and strangers have been drawn here, spirited into Barovia by the mists over the years, but they all die or disappear before long, . (Ismark has no knowledge of Death House, but vaguely remembers tales of unorthodox ways by which travelers have come to the valley.) There is no escaping Barovia once an outsider has entered it. Anyone who attempts to leave the land of Barovia begins to choke on the fog. Those who don't turn back perish.
- Just over three months ago, a man named Doru, the son of the village priest, raised a rebellion against the castle, hoping to free the valley from its prison in the mists. Their revolt failed, awakening Strahd from his dormancy and spurring the vampire to vow vengeance upon the village below.
- Several dozen Barovians fled to the town of Vallaki, almost a day’s travel to the west. The remainder stayed in the village, determined to defend their homes and those who were unable to make the journey.
Six nights ago, Strahd’s undead forces began attacking the town. Each night, the Barovians beat back multiple waves of the dead—and each night, the horde comes ever-closer to breaching the village’s defenses.
- Many Barovians fear that the village is doomed. The undead have infested the woods to the north, west, and south, blocking the Old Svalich Road just past the Ivlis River. With the Mists blocking passage to the east, the village has been effectively cut off from the world, left to survive on its own—or perish.
- Wolves, dire wolves, and werewolves prowl the Svalich
Woods, and hungry bats fill the skies at night.

- The village of Barovia sits at the east end of the valley.
Its burgomaster is named Kolyan Indirovich.
- The town of Vallaki lies in the heart of the valley. Its
burgomaster is named Baron Vargas Vallakovich.
- The fortified village of Krezk lies at the west end of
the valley and is built around an old abbey. The village.
burgomaster is named Dmitri Krezkov.
- Wine is the lifeblood of Barovia-for some, it is the
only reason to keep living. Barovian taverns get their
wine from the Wizard of Wines winery near Krezk.

***BELIEFS AND SUPERSTITIONS***
- Two divine forces watch over the Barovian people: the
Morninglord and Mother Night.
- Before the curse of Strahd befell the land, the Morninglord
watched over the Barovian people from sunrise
until sundown. Now, the sun has not shone unobscured
for centuries, and the Morninglord no longer
answers their prayers.
- The presence of Mother Night is felt most strongly
between dusk and dawn, although nighttime prayers
to her go unanswered. It is widely believed that she
has forsaken the Barovian people and sent the devil
Strahd to punish them for their ancestors' offenses.
- Spirits drift along the Old Svalich Road toward Castle
Ravenloft in the dead of night. These phantoms are all
that remain of Strahd's enemies, and this damnable
fate awaits anyone who opposes him.
The Vistani serve the devil Strahd. They alone are allowed
to leave Barovia.
- Never harm a raven, lest ill fortune befall you!

## Why Ismark is called "the Lesser,"
- When Strahd's dusk elf servant—a cruel-looking man named Rahadin—delivered his warning three months ago, many Barovians were prepared to flee the village for Vallaki.
- Ismark, however, delivered a thundering and inspiring speech, invoking the memory of Lugdana and Ismark the Great to encourage them to stay and fight for their homes. Most did so.
- When Strahd's siege began, many who lost homes or loved ones blamed Ismark, who they felt had led them astray with his foolish fantasies of heroism and valor. They now call him "Ismark the Lesser" in mockery of his ancestry.
- No one feels more guilty or ashamed than Ismark himself, who has taken the weight of every death incurred in the siege on his own shoulders.

## Ireena's take on Doru's rebellion
- Doru was a friend of theirs, and the son of the village priest Father Donavich. He was a bright and cheery young man, with a sunny disposition and a zeal for everything he did.
- Just over three months ago, without warning, Doru announced a crusade against Castle Ravenloft, which he proclaimed would free Barovia from the mists and return sunlight to the valley. Over two dozen young Barovians accompanied him, as well as a scholar from distant lands named Alanik Ray, who had been staying as a guest at Ismark and Ireena's home for the previous several weeks while studying Barovian history and ecology.
- Ireena doesn't recall much about Alanik, other than that he was a curious, somewhat intense man who kept to himself, took long walks into the Svalich Woods, and owned a pet monkey. She does remember, however, that he had a furious argument with Doru at one point, which confused her when he accompanied Doru to Castle Ravenloft shortly thereafter.

## Bildrath on the Seige of Barova
- Just over three months ago, a pack of would-be "revolutionaries" marched off to Castle Ravenloft to "slay the vampire." Doru, the son of Father Donavich, the village priest, "filled their heads with fairy tales" of banishing the Mists and bringing the Sun back to Barovia.
- None of the revolutionaries ever came back. A few days later, a dusk-skinned elf came to the village and announced that the village had ninety days to make peace with the gods before the lord of Castle Ravenloft—now awoken after a hundred years of slumber—exacted penance for their disobedience.
- Some villagers left. Many others wanted to leave. However, Ismark delivered a resounding speech in the village square before the statue of Ismark the Great, promising the villagers that those who remained would stand and defend their homes. "The audacity of the bastard," Bildrath sneers. "Standing in front of his great-grandfather's statue like he was worth a tenth of him."
- Bildrath wanted to leave—but his sister, Marta, and her husband, Dragomir, chose to stay with their son, Parriwimple, inspired by Ismark's words. Unwilling to leave his family, Bildrath stayed as well. "They figured they'd fight to defend what's theirs," he chokes out, blinking back tears. "Bloody idiots should've run, and never looked back."
- Ninety days after the elf delivered his proclamation, the undead came, swarming in hordes dozens strong from the Svalich Wood. The villagers fought back, defending the streets with barricades, swords, and arrows. "But the dead kept coming," Bildrath croaks. "And Marta—" He falls silent. (Bildrath lost Marta and Dragomir in the attacks, and blames Ismark for his failure to protect them, which left Parriwimple—Bildrath's nephew—an orphan.)
- When he's regained his composure, Bildrath warns the players that the village is doomed, and likely all of Barovia with it. "There's no sun to bring back," he spits. "No escape from the mists. This is Hell, now and for all eternity. The sooner you lot accept that, the better off you'll be."
- 
## Doru & Van Richten
- As a child, Doru was enraptured by stories of the sun and the light and hope that it once brought to the valley. As he grew older, he learned swordsmanship from Ismark and studied the book Van Richten’s Guide to Vampires to learn how to destroy the undead. He dreamed of one day destroying the Devil of Castle Ravenloft and bringing freedom to his people.
- Sixteen weeks ago, a foreign scholar calling himself Alanik Ray arrived in Barovia and rented a room in the burgomaster's manor. When an enormous undead dire wolf attacked a group of children who had strayed too far from the village, however, Doru alone saw "Alanik" fend it off with expert skill—and when the wolf knocked the hat off of "Alanik's" head, his appearance magically changed, revealing him to be the legendary vampire hunter Dr. Rudolph van Richten.
- Doru confronted him and insisted that Van Richten lead the village in revolt against Castle Ravenloft. Though Van Richten was reluctant at first, he eventually agreed—on the condition that Doru allow him to keep his disguise. Two days later, Doru, aided by a man named Escher—the village bard and Doru’s oldest friend—had assembled more than two dozen fighters to march on the keep.
- With Van Richten’s aid, the mob struck down any undead guards that tried to stand in their way. However, when they finally opened Strahd’s crypt, Escher was nowhere to be found—and Strahd’s coffin was empty. (If asked, Doru forcefully denies that Escher betrayed them.)
- Shortly thereafter, Strahd emerged from the shadows and attacked the mob with merciless force. Most of Doru’s companions were slain. Doru himself was turned into a vampire spawn, and later learned that Escher had been as well. Doru doesn’t know what happened to Van Richten, but was forced to confess the old man’s identity when Strahd interrogated him later.
- Doru spent nearly three months at Castle Ravenloft, during which Strahd repeatedly forced him to drink the blood of his former companions. Two weeks ago, Strahd commanded Doru to return to the church and his father.
- Doru can’t disobey Strahd’s direct orders, and can feel his presence at all times. His vampiric bloodthirst is a constant distraction, and it’s difficult to control his predatory urges and instincts. When he first returned to the church, he was almost grateful that his father had locked him in the undercroft, where he couldn’t do any harm.
- Doru doesn’t know if his soul or body can be saved, but he’s kept his father’s holy symbol to remind him of his faith and family, and to steel his will against the addictions of his new form. If not for that, he suspects that he would have lost control days or even weeks ago. (Doru doesn’t know why Strahd allowed him to keep it, but suspects that Strahd viewed it as a form of ironic amusement.)
-  about his argument with "Alanik," Doru admits, shamefacedly, that he forced Van Richten to accompany his rebels to the castle, threatening to march on Castle Ravenloft with or without Van Richten's help. (An enraged Van Richten ripped out the preface of Doru's copy of Van Richten's Guide to Vampires—which Doru bought from a Vistani caravan ten years prior—in order to make a point. "He warned me that faith and books meant nothing in the face of true evil," Doru murmurs. "I should have listened." Doru isn't sure what happened to the rest of the book.)

## Stanimir's Tale
Stanimir fills his mouth with wine, then spits into the fire.
The flames turn from orange to green. As they dance and
sway, a dark shape appears in the bonfire's core.

"We come from an ancient land whose name is long
forgotten-a land of kings. Our enemies forced us from
our homes, and now we wander the lost roads."

The dark shape in the fire takes the form of a man being
knocked from his horse, a spear piercing his side.

Stanimir continues. "One night, a wounded soldier
staggered into our camp and collapsed. We nursed his
terrible injury and quenched his thirst with wine. He
survived. When we asked him who he was, he wouldn't
say. All he wanted was to return home, but we were deep
in the land of his enemies. We took him as one of our
own and followed him back toward his homeland. His
enemies hunted him. They said he was a prince, yet we
didn't give him up, even when their assassins fell upon
us like wolves."

Deep in the bonfire, you see the dark figure standing
with sword drawn, fighting off a host of shadowy shapes.

"This man of royal blood fought to protect us, as we
protected him. We bore him safely to his home, and he
thanked us. He said, 'I owe you my life. Stay as long as
you wish, leave when you choose, and know that you will
always be safe here."'

“The figure in the dancing fire vanquishes its final foe, then disperses in a cloud of smoke and embers.” 

## Eliza’s Tale 
“It is said that within each raven flutters a lost soul, and that each raven’s song tells a tale of ages past. They whisper, so listen closely.”

She takes a deep breath; when she speaks again, her voice is quiet, with an eerie, melodic quality to it.

“Sing, ravens, of Barovia, birthed from the mists and bathed in twilight. Sing of Lugdana, the Morninglord’s stalwart, dawn-touched foe to the deep-lurking dark. The Holy Symbol of Ravenkind, her radiant testament, the warrior’s beacon of faithful resolve.

“Sing, ravens, of Chernovog’s rise, named Green-God and Demon-Lord upon Yester Hill. Lugdana, gray-haired, weary of battle, her longsword and shield yet polished and ready. Guided through shadows, toward sacred ground, she clashed with the demon, their tempest-like dance.

“Sing, ravens, of Lugdana’s last fury, of Ravenkind’s token now blazing with light. The battle’s tide turning, a hero’s brave cry, a final onslaught with divinity’s grace. The Demon-Lord banished, the warrior now fell, the wound at her side gouged too deep to bear.

“Sing, ravens, of light’s final moments, a shadow descending from radiance on high. Sing of the angel, black-feathered and beaked, the Morninglord’s angel reclaiming its gift. The Symbol retaken, in ravens’ claws held.

“Sing, ravens; you are the keepers, the watchers, the tellers of stories untold. Sing, ravens, of Lugdana’s memory, the shadows that lurk, and heroes to come.”

## Arturi’s Tale
There once was a Fox, renowned for his wisdom and skill, who dwelled with his kit in the misted woods. On a cold, moonlit night, a pair of Sparrows brought him their child, the tendrils of Death clutching its shivering body. The Fox took the chick into his den, but for all his knowledge, he could not cure its ailment, and it breathed its last in his paws.

Driven mad in their grief, the vengeful Sparrows, aided by four of their kin, stole the Fox's kit in the night. They delivered him to the Wolf, who had long hungered for the taste of fox-flesh. The Wolf devoured the kit, and the Sparrows departed to return to their flock.

When the Fox found what the Sparrows had done, rage clutched his own heart. In his cunning, he knew that the Rats, in their burrows beneath the earth, had always despised the songs of the Sparrows far above. The Fox descended to the kingdom of the Rats, and he promised them a forest free of the songs of the Sparrows. Intrigued, the Rats agreed.

The Rats could not find the Sparrows' nest alone. But the crafty Fox could, and as the Sparrows slumbered in the hollow of a great oak, the Rats fell upon them to feast with tooth and claw. For the crimes of six, the flock perished, with nary an egg spared.

The misted wood is darkened, now, and the trees no longer sing with the songs of the Sparrows. But some say that the Rats hunt still—that a lone chick yet escaped their clutches, and that one day, they will find it, and gobble it up like the rest.

## Ireena’s Tale 
"When I was a child, my father took me and my brother to a vast, tranquil lake. I remember the sand beneath my bare feet, and the lapping of the waves against the shore.

"But then, something broke the silence—a low growl that echoed through the wind. As I turned, I saw a beast emerge from the fog: a wolf, far larger than any I'd ever seen. I still remember its eyes—yellow, cold, and hungry.

"My father screamed for me to run. I took off for the woods, and the wolf followed, its snarls echoing through the underbrush. I remember branches whipping against my face, thorns cutting at my feet as my legs burned and my breath grew ragged, but my fear drove me forward.

"It was only much later, when my heart had quieted in my chest and the wolf's footsteps had faded into silence, that I finally allowed myself to stop. By then, though, the woods were strange to me, and my father's shouts had faded.

"A heavy mist had descended around me, and shadowed shapes lurked in every corner. I stepped forward, one hand reaching fearfully into the fog—and a wolf made of mist leapt forth, its jaws opened wide to devour me. And then—everything went black.

"The next thing I remembered, I awoke in my own bed, my father's humming echoing from the kitchen. I don't know how I got there, or what became of the wolf, but I can still remember its teeth as clearly as ever."

## Kasmir & the Dusk Elves
- Even now, nearly five centuries past, the memories are sharp and clear in my mind, like shards of broken glass. I was a mere century old when my people lost their freedom—when the tyranny of the von Zarovich clan rose like a shadow across the land.
- It was not Strahd that shattered the peace, but his father, King Barov von Zarovich II. In those days, our people dwelled in Othrondil, the Forest of Twilight. A council of princes ruled us, led by Erevan Löwenhart, my uncle and a master in the art of bladesong. When King Barov's eyes fell upon our lands, he demanded our fealty—our tribute to the borders of old Zarovia, the kingdom his ancestors once ruled. Erevan, who practiced the style of the lion and bore the lion's sigil, was never one to bow, however, and refused. His act of defiance ignited the fires of war.
- Barov's conquest was swift and brutal. His forces, joined by Rahadin, my cousin, and a traitor to our people, laid waste to our kingdom. I was a mage and scribe in Erevan's court—I saw Rahadin shatter Erevan’s blade and execute his family, marking the end of the royal line. My people were subjugated; those that resisted were hunted like rabbits.
- Barov ruled over us with an iron fist—and when he died and his son, Strahd, came to power, we rose in rebellion, leading the charge for freedom. But Strahd was even more cunning and cruel than his sire. He quashed our revolt in a matter of days, and slaughtered our people in a genocide that left less than a hundred alive. He left us, the survivors, to the mercies of the Vistani, who took us into their caravans and led us to sanctuary in this valley.
- Strahd's hunger for conquest, however, was endless. Within a year, the last of his enemies had fallen, and he had claimed the valley for his own, naming it "Barovia." We found ourselves trapped, imprisoned in the heart of our conqueror's new empire. By then, however, we had built a home here, and chose to remain—hoping, in our heart of hearts, that the Vistani's kindness would keep us safe. And so here we have remained ever since.

## Lady Wachter on Izek Strazni
- Izek was orphaned at the age of ten, losing his younger sister and arm in a wolf attack, and both of his parents to grief not long thereafter. His sister’s body was never found.
- Izek was often mocked for his disability, but after several of his tormentors went missing, the laughter abruptly stopped. No bodies were ever found, but rumors persist that Izek—a large and frequently violent child—murdered them himself.
- Approximately a year after losing his parents, Izek was arrested by the town guard and brought to the Vallakovich mansion. No one knows what crime he committed or why he was released soon thereafter, but Valentin Vallakovich’s twenty-five-year-old son, then-Baronet Vargas Vallakovich, all but adopted Izek and took him into their home.
- Izek served the Vallakovich family faithfully for the next five years. When Izek was sixteen, he somehow obtained a new arm to replace the one he had lost—though his new limb more resembled a devil’s than any human form. (Curiously, the day that Izek regrew his arm came the same day that Baron Valentin Vallakovich was announced to have passed in his sleep. Lady Wachter is confident that the two events are connected.)
- Izek’s fiendish arm allowed him to wield a proper weapon—but, more significantly, magically gave him the power to conjure fire. Vargas soon put both of Izek’s skills to work, designating Izek his personal enforcer and a ranking member of Vallaki’s town guard. As time passed, Izek became a terror throughout Vallaki, committing wanton acts of battery, arson, and extortion both at the Baron’s command and to serve his own diabolic whims.
- Many of the townsfolk hate and fear Izek—a sentiment that has slowly spread to Vargas as well in the wake of Strahd’s revival. However, Izek’s strength protects them both, swiftly dispatching any person who dares defy them, and intimidating those that don’t.

## Khazan's Tower
- Long ago, Khazan built a wizard’s tower, which he imbued with powerful enchantments, including a protective field that prevented any other spellcasters from using magic within its reach.

## Lady Wachter & Leo Dilisnya
- When Lady Wachter was a young woman, her parents and brother were killed in a mysterious incident that left their bodies apparently unharmed. Lady Wachter was the sole survivor, having been away from Wachterhaus at the time of the killing.
- When she returned to Wachterhaus, she determined that a malevolent spirit had been responsible for her family’s death. Though the spirit appeared to have departed by the time Lady Wachter returned, she was wary of the prospect that it might one day return.
- Using magic that she had learned from her mentor, Lysa, Lady Wachter erected a protective barrier around Wachterhaus that would prevent any creature within the Ethereal Plane from crossing over the boundary of the property.
- Leo Dilisnya, a guard of Castle Ravenloft. When Strahd killed his brother, Sergei, and pursued Sergei’s bride, Tatyana, through the castle gardens, it was Leo who gave the order for the guards to kill Strahd to defend Tatyana and avenge Sergei’s death.
- When Strahd became a vampire, he slaughtered his castle guards in a bloody and gruesome massacre. Lady Lovina Wachter née Dilisnya, Leo’s sister and a faithful devotee of Strahd von Zarovich, directed her bodyguards to assist Strahd in the bloodshed.
- Leo himself barely escaped, and hid himself away in the deserted Abbey of Saint Markovia on a spur of Mount Baratok. However, Strahd and Lovina eventually found him—and when they did, they turned him into a vampire spawn and sealed him in a lightless stone vault beneath Wachterhaus.
- They left him there to starve for four hundred years, slowly growing mad as the bloodthirst destroyed his mind and his hatred sharpened and burned. (“Do you have any idea what that’s like?” the gallows speaker snarls, the faces within its cloak moaning with a chorus of mournful wails. “Feeling your sanity slip away, year by year, as the hunger within you twists and grows, never to be sated?”)
- More than thirty years ago, Leo finally died, his spirit arising as a ghost that reunited with the tormented spirits of the castle guards, forming a gallows speaker. As he lurked unseen among Wachterhaus, he came to learn that he had been granted the release of death on the same night that Fiona Wachter—then a teenager—had fled her family estate, destroying an enchanted ruby gemstone that Strahd had given Lovina’s family as security should Leo ever escape.
- Not long after his death, Leo killed the Wachters that remained at Wachterhaus, but was unable to finish the job when Fiona Wachter sealed him out. Now, however, Leo seeks to “rip out the poisoned Wachter family tree, root and branch,” and finally “see justice done.”
- In life, Leo was an assassin of the Ba’al Verzi who betrayed his order’s vows when he sought to kill Strahd in vengeance for the death of his brother, Reinhold, who Strahd knowingly sent to die to win a battle against the Order of the Silver Dragon.
- On the morning of Sergei’s wedding, Leo climbed to the window of Strahd’s royal chambers, carrying with him a cursed Ba’al Verzi dagger that prevented its victims from being resurrected.
- When Lovina Wachter’s bodyguards engaged the castle guards to defend Strahd, it was Leo who gave the order to have the Wachters themselves killed, furious that his sister had elected to “betray” him and Reinhold’s memory.

## Kavan & the First Folk
Long ago, Kavan was a chieftain among the First Folk, whose people arrived in the valley long before Kavan’s own birth.

The First Folk worshipped a trio of goddesses known as the Rozana, or the Ladies Three: the Seeker, the Weaver, and the Huntress. The druids of the First Folk paid homage to the Ladies at their holy sites—three fanes that dwelled within the valley, known as the Mountain Fane, the Forest Fane, and the Swamp Fane. Each Fane held a gemstone imbued with the power of the Weaver, which was said to give life and vitality to the wilderness around it. "This wand," Kavan notes somberly, "was once wielded by those who connected our people to the Rozana."

Nearly one thousand years ago, Kavan came to power as chieftain of his tribe. Arrogant and proud, he defied his people’s strictures and ventured forth into the Whispering Wall, a wall of thick fog said to hold the corpse of the Devourer—an ancient monster that the Ladies killed long before.

While within the Wall, Kavan learned terrible secrets—including the means by which he could steal the Huntress’s sacred spear from the Forest Fane and claim its power for his own. Upon doing so, he waged war on the other tribes, reuniting them beneath his own banner. The servants of the Seeker, a clan of wereravens, hid away the life-giving gems that blessed the Fanes to conceal them from his ambitions, and vanished into the wilderness. (Upon saying this, Kavan gives Muriel a long, meaningful look, though he cannot confirm whether she is spiritually descended from one of the original wereravens that served the Seeker.)

The druids of the First Folk condemned Kavan for his hubris, and retreated to the village of Soldav in the Balinok Mountains, their people’s most sacred site and the center of their faith. They named Kavan “enemy," and banished him from Soldav for his crimes. When he died, instead of burying him in a place of honor upon Yester Hill with the great chieftains of the past, the druids buried him here, in a lonely cairn far from the graves of his forefathers. Kavan has been haunted by his isolation from his people as a result ever since his death.

In Kavan’s ailing years, a tyrant named King Dostron the Hellborn invaded the valley with his army, scattering the First Folk and destroying their homes. He dammed up the Luna River to make farmland, and shattered the First Folks’ faith in the Ladies Three. When Dostron died, his armies withdrew and abandoned his fortress, but the First Folk remained apart and weak.

When Strahd invaded the valley hundreds of years later, many members of the druidic caste—still angered by Kavan’s betrayal and Dostron’s oppression—sought out his protection. A great schism split the First Folk, with those who opposed Strahd retreating to Soldav and those who favored Strahd remaining within the Svalich Wood. Today, Barovians know them as the Mountain Folk and the Forest Folk. The land of Barovia, which the First Folk once called “Girvisa"—meaning “fertile land"—has been corrupted by Strahd’s will and magic. Kavan doesn’t understand the nature of Strahd’s corruption, but he knows that Strahd draws power from the land, and that this profane connection causes great suffering to the creatures and landscape of the valley. To learn how to cleanse Strahd’s corruption, the players must travel to Soldav to seek the guidance of an elder of the faith of the Rozana among the Mountain Folk. (Only an elder of the faith of the Rozana can conjure and maintain the mist that shields Soldav from outsiders.)

Soldav is hidden somewhere in the Balinok Mountains, protected by a shroud of enchanted mist. So long as the mist remains, Soldav’s enemies can never find it, nor can they remember where it lies. Kavan remembers only the landmark that marks its entrance: a place in the mountains where two waterfalls run together. "Without a token of the Ladies, however," he warns, "you will never find the entrance, nor will Soldav's elders grant you entry."

## Origins of The Keepers of the feather
The Keepers were first founded by Livius Martikov, Davian’s grandfather and a little-known accomplice of the paladin Lugdana, who rooted out nests of vampire spawn across the valley using the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind one hundred years ago.

As a younger man, Livius helped Lugdana and Burgomaster Ismark Antonovich steal the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind—then called the Sigil of the Sun—from Castle Ravenloft shortly after Strahd began his hibernation. (Livius stole it, as well as the Tome of Strahd, from the depths of the catacombs while Ismark and Lugdana distracted Strahd’s servants and children.)

It was Ismark the Great who proposed renaming the Sigil to be the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind in order to inspire the Barovian people and conceal its origins, crafting a tale in which an angel in the shape of a raven delivered the relic to Lugdana directly. (Livius always found the tale incredibly amusing.) Lugdana would continue to wield the Holy Symbol until her death fighting the Green God Chernovog, a greater demon conjured by the mad witch Baba Zelenna, atop Yester Hill. The Holy Symbol was thought lost when Lugdana fell—seemingly for good.

## Sir Godfrey & Argynvost
A great battle took place on the floodplain east of the mansion, and many of the knights of the Order were slaughtered. As Godfrey and his commander, Vladimir Horngaard, led a final sortie against the enemy general’s camp, both were killed as well—Commander Horngaard by Zarovich himself, and Godfrey by Zarovich’s second-in-command: a cruel-eyed dusk elf bearing twin scimitars. (If asked, Godfrey can confirm that the elf was Rahadin, the current chamberlain of Castle Ravenloft.)

Several years thereafter, Godfrey felt Commander Horngaard’s rage pull his soul from beyond the grave, and found himself and the other knights of the Order returned to life as undead revenants. He learned that Zarovich had desecrated Argynvost’s remains, burning the dragon's bones and taking his skull as a trophy to the new Castle Ravenloft—an act so foul it had stirred Horngaard to vengeful hatred even in death.

The revenant knights renewed the fight against Strahd, waging war for months—until the Mists descended upon Barovia. The knights marched on Castle Ravenloft, where the Vistani crone Madam Eva met them at the castle gates. She told them Strahd had died and been reborn, and that he and all Barovia were now captives of the Mists.

Commander Horngaard and the knights returned to Argynvostholt. There, Commander Horngaard, his heart still clutched by hate, forbade the members of the Order from fighting Zarovich, who Commander Horngaard believed deserved to suffer in his prison for all eternity. Later, Commander Horngaard expanded his interdiction to Strahd’s servants and creatures as well, believing that Strahd’s dark dominion would only drive him to deeper levels of pain and misery—for what was a conqueror without anything left to conquer?

The knights of the Order reluctantly obeyed Horngaard’s order, even as they watched the people of Barovia sink deeper into despair. As Strahd slumbered in his tomb, many among them came to believe that the Barovians’ nightmare may one day lift—until a knight came bearing news of a failed rebellion from the village of Barovia to the southeast, and Strahd’s threat to wipe the village and its people from the valley.

A great quarrel erupted, as the knights demanded the right to defend the village from Strahd’s vengeance. Commander Horngaard, angered by their defiance, banished the other knights from the mansion. Only Godfrey, restrained by his bindings, did Horngaard allow to remain.

Argynvost may have fallen in the war against Strahd, but his spirit still lingers at Argynvostholt. In the decades after the Mists first descended, the dragon’s spirit appeared to Commander Horngaard in flickering visions, urging him away from his path of hatred and vengeance. However, Horngaard never turned from his path, and Argynvost’s spirit gradually fell quiet, sinking into a silent, dormant slumber.

Shortly after Strahd awoke from his hibernation, Argynvost’s spirit began to stir again, though Godfrey doesn’t know why. The dragon’s spirit is too old and weak to manifest directly, but several of the other ghosts that haunt the mansion’s halls claim to have heard him whispering in his ethereal slumber, murmuring of a new generation of heroes, and a new and final front in the fight against darkness. When the knights of the order were banished from Argynvostholt, Godfrey sent them to seek out those who Argynvost might be searching for, and direct them toward the manor.

## Arabelle's Prophecy
In darkest night, the light shall flee,<br>
No dawn to break, with no reprieve.<br>
From the grave, the dead shall climb,<br>
Their restless march a baleful sign.<br>
At castle’s peak, a heart beats red,<br>
Its hunger deep and ever-fed.<br>
Should silence fall, the skies shall crack,<br>
A thousand souls in torment black.<br>

## Muriel's overheard prophecy involving Strahd.
"The Darklord—the master of shadows, the beast in the labyrinth that tears at his chains.<br>
"The Six of Stars, the Evoker—the power you covet, a force untamed by mortal hands, raw and wild with burning fury.<br>
"The Artifact—the token you seek, the key to power. Divinity’s heart waits, but where?<br>
"The Innocent. I see a maid of raven hair and twilit eyes. She is one way to the token.<br>
"But there is another—the Broken One. The path of sacrifice opens another door. The wall that whispers awaits your tribute."<br>

## Baba Lysaga's Scrying of Illya Krezkov:
“I see a boy,” she hisses, “adolescent, shaggy-haired, and claw-scarred.” Her voice is a mixture of intrigue and mockery, and she licks her lips in obvious amusement. “They have collared him with silver, and chained him to a post. There he sits, huddled and pathetic. His eyes, oh, they are hidden, buried in his knees as he snivels and sobs.”

She frowns, as if concentrating, and her voice drops to a rasping whisper. “The post is in a cavern—a dismal chamber lit by flickering torchlight. There is a woman chained beside him, sharp-eyed and with long, shaggy hair. I smell the gift of Mother Night on her. Nearby, I see a statue of a woman, wolf-headed—an idol to Mother Night, adorned in garlands and surrounded by a bounty of treasure. Rotting corpses kneel before her, bent to her majesty.”

## Morgantha's Secrets
- Strahd’s most carefully guarded secret is a temple of forbidden lore hidden in the mountains. It is known as the Amber Temple, and it is the place where he first met the entity with which he forged his terrible pact. (Morgantha doesn’t know the temple’s location or the nature of Strahd’s pact.)
- Strahd von Zarovich seeks to escape from the grasp of the Mists. He has prepared a dark and secret plot to do so, harnessing the power of three ancient shrines to defy the will of the Dark Powers that rule this land. (Morgantha doesn’t know the specifics of his plot or the nature of the shrines, but knows that one of the three shrines is located among the circle of standing stones located at the base of the windmill’s hill.)
- Unbeknownst to Strahd, a traitor lurks in his midst: his eldest wife and vampire spawn Sasha Ivliskova. (Morgantha is wildly amused by this treachery, and has taken no action to warn Strahd of her conflicted loyalties.)
