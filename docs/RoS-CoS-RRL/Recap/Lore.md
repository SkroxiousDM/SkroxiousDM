## Kasmir & the Dusk Elves
Even now, nearly five centuries past, the memories are sharp and clear in my mind, like shards of broken glass. I was a mere century old when my people lost their freedom—when the tyranny of the von Zarovich clan rose like a shadow across the land.

It was not Strahd that shattered the peace, but his father, King Barov von Zarovich II. In those days, our people dwelled in Othrondil, the Forest of Twilight. A council of princes ruled us, led by Erevan Löwenhart, my uncle and a master in the art of bladesong. When King Barov's eyes fell upon our lands, he demanded our fealty—our tribute to the borders of old Zarovia, the kingdom his ancestors once ruled. Erevan, who practiced the style of the lion and bore the lion's sigil, was never one to bow, however, and refused. His act of defiance ignited the fires of war.

Barov's conquest was swift and brutal. His forces, joined by Rahadin, my cousin, and a traitor to our people, laid waste to our kingdom. I was a mage and scribe in Erevan's court—I saw Rahadin shatter Erevan’s blade and execute his family, marking the end of the royal line. My people were subjugated; those that resisted were hunted like rabbits.

Barov ruled over us with an iron fist—and when he died and his son, Strahd, came to power, we rose in rebellion, leading the charge for freedom. But Strahd was even more cunning and cruel than his sire. He quashed our revolt in a matter of days, and slaughtered our people in a genocide that left less than a hundred alive. He left us, the survivors, to the mercies of the Vistani, who took us into their caravans and led us to sanctuary in this valley.

Strahd's hunger for conquest, however, was endless. Within a year, the last of his enemies had fallen, and he had claimed the valley for his own, naming it "Barovia." We found ourselves trapped, imprisoned in the heart of our conqueror's new empire. By then, however, we had built a home here, and chose to remain—hoping, in our heart of hearts, that the Vistani's kindness would keep us safe. And so here we have remained ever since.

## Khazan's Tower
Long ago, Khazan built a wizard’s tower, which he imbued with powerful enchantments, including a protective field that prevented any other spellcasters from using magic within its reach.

## Lady Wachter & Leo Dilisnya
When Lady Wachter was a young woman, her parents and brother were killed in a mysterious incident that left their bodies apparently unharmed. Lady Wachter was the sole survivor, having been away from Wachterhaus at the time of the killing.

When she returned to Wachterhaus, she determined that a malevolent spirit had been responsible for her family’s death. Though the spirit appeared to have departed by the time Lady Wachter returned, she was wary of the prospect that it might one day return.

Using magic that she had learned from her mentor, Lysa, Lady Wachter erected a protective barrier around Wachterhaus that would prevent any creature within the Ethereal Plane from crossing over the boundary of the property.

Leo Dilisnya, a guard of Castle Ravenloft. When Strahd killed his brother, Sergei, and pursued Sergei’s bride, Tatyana, through the castle gardens, it was Leo who gave the order for the guards to kill Strahd to defend Tatyana and avenge Sergei’s death.

When Strahd became a vampire, he slaughtered his castle guards in a bloody and gruesome massacre. Lady Lovina Wachter née Dilisnya, Leo’s sister and a faithful devotee of Strahd von Zarovich, directed her bodyguards to assist Strahd in the bloodshed.

Leo himself barely escaped, and hid himself away in the deserted Abbey of Saint Markovia on a spur of Mount Baratok. However, Strahd and Lovina eventually found him—and when they did, they turned him into a vampire spawn and sealed him in a lightless stone vault beneath Wachterhaus.

They left him there to starve for four hundred years, slowly growing mad as the bloodthirst destroyed his mind and his hatred sharpened and burned. (“Do you have any idea what that’s like?” the gallows speaker snarls, the faces within its cloak moaning with a chorus of mournful wails. “Feeling your sanity slip away, year by year, as the hunger within you twists and grows, never to be sated?”)

More than thirty years ago, Leo finally died, his spirit arising as a ghost that reunited with the tormented spirits of the castle guards, forming a gallows speaker. As he lurked unseen among Wachterhaus, he came to learn that he had been granted the release of death on the same night that Fiona Wachter—then a teenager—had fled her family estate, destroying an enchanted ruby gemstone that Strahd had given Lovina’s family as security should Leo ever escape.

Not long after his death, Leo killed the Wachters that remained at Wachterhaus, but was unable to finish the job when Fiona Wachter sealed him out. Now, however, Leo seeks to “rip out the poisoned Wachter family tree, root and branch,” and finally “see justice done.”

In life, Leo was an assassin of the Ba’al Verzi who betrayed his order’s vows when he sought to kill Strahd in vengeance for the death of his brother, Reinhold, who Strahd knowingly sent to die to win a battle against the Order of the Silver Dragon.

On the morning of Sergei’s wedding, Leo climbed to the window of Strahd’s royal chambers, carrying with him a cursed Ba’al Verzi dagger that prevented its victims from being resurrected.

When Lovina Wachter’s bodyguards engaged the castle guards to defend Strahd, it was Leo who gave the order to have the Wachters themselves killed, furious that his sister had elected to “betray” him and Reinhold’s memory.

## Kavan & the First Folk
Long ago, Kavan was a chieftain among the First Folk, whose people arrived in the valley long before Kavan’s own birth.

The First Folk worshipped a trio of goddesses known as the Rozana, or the Ladies Three: the Seeker, the Weaver, and the Huntress. The druids of the First Folk paid homage to the Ladies at their holy sites—three fanes that dwelled within the valley, known as the Mountain Fane, the Forest Fane, and the Swamp Fane. Each Fane held a gemstone imbued with the power of the Weaver, which was said to give life and vitality to the wilderness around it. "This wand," Kavan notes somberly, "was once wielded by those who connected our people to the Rozana."

Nearly one thousand years ago, Kavan came to power as chieftain of his tribe. Arrogant and proud, he defied his people’s strictures and ventured forth into the Whispering Wall, a wall of thick fog said to hold the corpse of the Devourer—an ancient monster that the Ladies killed long before.

While within the Wall, Kavan learned terrible secrets—including the means by which he could steal the Huntress’s sacred spear from the Forest Fane and claim its power for his own. Upon doing so, he waged war on the other tribes, reuniting them beneath his own banner. The servants of the Seeker, a clan of wereravens, hid away the life-giving gems that blessed the Fanes to conceal them from his ambitions, and vanished into the wilderness. (Upon saying this, Kavan gives Muriel a long, meaningful look, though he cannot confirm whether she is spiritually descended from one of the original wereravens that served the Seeker.)

The druids of the First Folk condemned Kavan for his hubris, and retreated to the village of Soldav in the Balinok Mountains, their people’s most sacred site and the center of their faith. They named Kavan “enemy," and banished him from Soldav for his crimes. When he died, instead of burying him in a place of honor upon Yester Hill with the great chieftains of the past, the druids buried him here, in a lonely cairn far from the graves of his forefathers. Kavan has been haunted by his isolation from his people as a result ever since his death.

In Kavan’s ailing years, a tyrant named King Dostron the Hellborn invaded the valley with his army, scattering the First Folk and destroying their homes. He dammed up the Luna River to make farmland, and shattered the First Folks’ faith in the Ladies Three. When Dostron died, his armies withdrew and abandoned his fortress, but the First Folk remained apart and weak.

When Strahd invaded the valley hundreds of years later, many members of the druidic caste—still angered by Kavan’s betrayal and Dostron’s oppression—sought out his protection. A great schism split the First Folk, with those who opposed Strahd retreating to Soldav and those who favored Strahd remaining within the Svalich Wood. Today, Barovians know them as the Mountain Folk and the Forest Folk. The land of Barovia, which the First Folk once called “Girvisa"—meaning “fertile land"—has been corrupted by Strahd’s will and magic. Kavan doesn’t understand the nature of Strahd’s corruption, but he knows that Strahd draws power from the land, and that this profane connection causes great suffering to the creatures and landscape of the valley. To learn how to cleanse Strahd’s corruption, the players must travel to Soldav to seek the guidance of an elder of the faith of the Rozana among the Mountain Folk. (Only an elder of the faith of the Rozana can conjure and maintain the mist that shields Soldav from outsiders.)

Soldav is hidden somewhere in the Balinok Mountains, protected by a shroud of enchanted mist. So long as the mist remains, Soldav’s enemies can never find it, nor can they remember where it lies. Kavan remembers only the landmark that marks its entrance: a place in the mountains where two waterfalls run together. "Without a token of the Ladies, however," he warns, "you will never find the entrance, nor will Soldav's elders grant you entry."

## Sir Godfrey & Argynvost
A great battle took place on the floodplain east of the mansion, and many of the knights of the Order were slaughtered. As Godfrey and his commander, Vladimir Horngaard, led a final sortie against the enemy general’s camp, both were killed as well—Commander Horngaard by Zarovich himself, and Godfrey by Zarovich’s second-in-command: a cruel-eyed dusk elf bearing twin scimitars. (If asked, Godfrey can confirm that the elf was Rahadin, the current chamberlain of Castle Ravenloft.)

Several years thereafter, Godfrey felt Commander Horngaard’s rage pull his soul from beyond the grave, and found himself and the other knights of the Order returned to life as undead revenants. He learned that Zarovich had desecrated Argynvost’s remains, burning the dragon's bones and taking his skull as a trophy to the new Castle Ravenloft—an act so foul it had stirred Horngaard to vengeful hatred even in death.

The revenant knights renewed the fight against Strahd, waging war for months—until the Mists descended upon Barovia. The knights marched on Castle Ravenloft, where the Vistani crone Madam Eva met them at the castle gates. She told them Strahd had died and been reborn, and that he and all Barovia were now captives of the Mists.

Commander Horngaard and the knights returned to Argynvostholt. There, Commander Horngaard, his heart still clutched by hate, forbade the members of the Order from fighting Zarovich, who Commander Horngaard believed deserved to suffer in his prison for all eternity. Later, Commander Horngaard expanded his interdiction to Strahd’s servants and creatures as well, believing that Strahd’s dark dominion would only drive him to deeper levels of pain and misery—for what was a conqueror without anything left to conquer?

The knights of the Order reluctantly obeyed Horngaard’s order, even as they watched the people of Barovia sink deeper into despair. As Strahd slumbered in his tomb, many among them came to believe that the Barovians’ nightmare may one day lift—until a knight came bearing news of a failed rebellion from the village of Barovia to the southeast, and Strahd’s threat to wipe the village and its people from the valley.

A great quarrel erupted, as the knights demanded the right to defend the village from Strahd’s vengeance. Commander Horngaard, angered by their defiance, banished the other knights from the mansion. Only Godfrey, restrained by his bindings, did Horngaard allow to remain.

Argynvost may have fallen in the war against Strahd, but his spirit still lingers at Argynvostholt. In the decades after the Mists first descended, the dragon’s spirit appeared to Commander Horngaard in flickering visions, urging him away from his path of hatred and vengeance. However, Horngaard never turned from his path, and Argynvost’s spirit gradually fell quiet, sinking into a silent, dormant slumber.

Shortly after Strahd awoke from his hibernation, Argynvost’s spirit began to stir again, though Godfrey doesn’t know why. The dragon’s spirit is too old and weak to manifest directly, but several of the other ghosts that haunt the mansion’s halls claim to have heard him whispering in his ethereal slumber, murmuring of a new generation of heroes, and a new and final front in the fight against darkness. When the knights of the order were banished from Argynvostholt, Godfrey sent them to seek out those who Argynvost might be searching for, and direct them toward the manor.

## Arabelle's Prophecy
In darkest night, the light shall flee,<br>
No dawn to break, with no reprieve.<br>
From the grave, the dead shall climb,<br>
Their restless march a baleful sign.<br>
At castle’s peak, a heart beats red,<br>
Its hunger deep and ever-fed.<br>
Should silence fall, the skies shall crack,<br>
A thousand souls in torment black.<br>

## Muriel's overheard prophecy involving Strahd.
"The Darklord—the master of shadows, the beast in the labyrinth that tears at his chains.<br>
"The Six of Stars, the Evoker—the power you covet, a force untamed by mortal hands, raw and wild with burning fury.<br>
"The Artifact—the token you seek, the key to power. Divinity’s heart waits, but where?<br>
"The Innocent. I see a maid of raven hair and twilit eyes. She is one way to the token.<br>
"But there is another—the Broken One. The path of sacrifice opens another door. The wall that whispers awaits your tribute."<br>

## Baba Lysaga's Scrying of Illya Krezkov:
“I see a boy,” she hisses, “adolescent, shaggy-haired, and claw-scarred.” Her voice is a mixture of intrigue and mockery, and she licks her lips in obvious amusement. “They have collared him with silver, and chained him to a post. There he sits, huddled and pathetic. His eyes, oh, they are hidden, buried in his knees as he snivels and sobs.”

She frowns, as if concentrating, and her voice drops to a rasping whisper. “The post is in a cavern—a dismal chamber lit by flickering torchlight. There is a woman chained beside him, sharp-eyed and with long, shaggy hair. I smell the gift of Mother Night on her. Nearby, I see a statue of a woman, wolf-headed—an idol to Mother Night, adorned in garlands and surrounded by a bounty of treasure. Rotting corpses kneel before her, bent to her majesty.”

## Morgantha's Secrets
- Strahd’s most carefully guarded secret is a temple of forbidden lore hidden in the mountains. It is known as the Amber Temple, and it is the place where he first met the entity with which he forged his terrible pact. (Morgantha doesn’t know the temple’s location or the nature of Strahd’s pact.)
- Strahd von Zarovich seeks to escape from the grasp of the Mists. He has prepared a dark and secret plot to do so, harnessing the power of three ancient shrines to defy the will of the Dark Powers that rule this land. (Morgantha doesn’t know the specifics of his plot or the nature of the shrines, but knows that one of the three shrines is located among the circle of standing stones located at the base of the windmill’s hill.)
- Unbeknownst to Strahd, a traitor lurks in his midst: his eldest wife and vampire spawn Sasha Ivliskova. (Morgantha is wildly amused by this treachery, and has taken no action to warn Strahd of her conflicted loyalties.)
