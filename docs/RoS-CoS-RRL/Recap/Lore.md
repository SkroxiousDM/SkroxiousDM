# History
## Ismark and Barovia
- The players have entered the land of Barovia, a realm surrounded by deadly fog and ruled by Strahd von Zarovich, a powerful vampire who slumbered in Castle Ravenloft until recently.
-Many outsiders and strangers have been drawn here, spirited into Barovia by the mists over the years, but they all die or disappear before long, . (Ismark has no knowledge of Death House, but vaguely remembers tales of unorthodox ways by which travelers have come to the valley.) There is no escaping Barovia once an outsider has entered it. Anyone who attempts to leave the land of Barovia begins to choke on the fog. Those who don't turn back perish.
- Just over three months ago, a man named Doru, the son of the village priest, raised a rebellion against the castle, hoping to free the valley from its prison in the mists. Their revolt failed, awakening Strahd from his dormancy and spurring the vampire to vow vengeance upon the village below.
- Several dozen Barovians fled to the town of Vallaki, almost a day’s travel to the west. The remainder stayed in the village, determined to defend their homes and those who were unable to make the journey.
Six nights ago, Strahd’s undead forces began attacking the town. Each night, the Barovians beat back multiple waves of the dead—and each night, the horde comes ever-closer to breaching the village’s defenses.
- Many Barovians fear that the village is doomed. The undead have infested the woods to the north, west, and south, blocking the Old Svalich Road just past the Ivlis River. With the Mists blocking passage to the east, the village has been effectively cut off from the world, left to survive on its own—or perish.
- Wolves, dire wolves, and werewolves prowl the Svalich
Woods, and hungry bats fill the skies at night.

- The village of Barovia sits at the east end of the valley.
Its burgomaster is named Kolyan Indirovich.
- The town of Vallaki lies in the heart of the valley. Its
burgomaster is named Baron Vargas Vallakovich.
- The fortified village of Krezk lies at the west end of
the valley and is built around an old abbey. The village.
burgomaster is named Dmitri Krezkov.
- Wine is the lifeblood of Barovia-for some, it is the
only reason to keep living. Barovian taverns get their
wine from the Wizard of Wines winery near Krezk.

***BELIEFS AND SUPERSTITIONS***
- Two divine forces watch over the Barovian people: the
Morninglord and Mother Night.
- Before the curse of Strahd befell the land, the Morninglord
watched over the Barovian people from sunrise
until sundown. Now, the sun has not shone unobscured
for centuries, and the Morninglord no longer
answers their prayers.
- The presence of Mother Night is felt most strongly
between dusk and dawn, although nighttime prayers
to her go unanswered. It is widely believed that she
has forsaken the Barovian people and sent the devil
Strahd to punish them for their ancestors' offenses.
- Spirits drift along the Old Svalich Road toward Castle
Ravenloft in the dead of night. These phantoms are all
that remain of Strahd's enemies, and this damnable
fate awaits anyone who opposes him.
The Vistani serve the devil Strahd. They alone are allowed
to leave Barovia.
- Never harm a raven, lest ill fortune befall you!

## Why Ismark is called "the Lesser,"
- When Strahd's dusk elf servant—a cruel-looking man named Rahadin—delivered his warning three months ago, many Barovians were prepared to flee the village for Vallaki.
- Ismark, however, delivered a thundering and inspiring speech, invoking the memory of Lugdana and Ismark the Great to encourage them to stay and fight for their homes. Most did so.
- When Strahd's siege began, many who lost homes or loved ones blamed Ismark, who they felt had led them astray with his foolish fantasies of heroism and valor. They now call him "Ismark the Lesser" in mockery of his ancestry.
- No one feels more guilty or ashamed than Ismark himself, who has taken the weight of every death incurred in the siege on his own shoulders.

## Ireena's take on Doru's rebellion
- Doru was a friend of theirs, and the son of the village priest Father Donavich. He was a bright and cheery young man, with a sunny disposition and a zeal for everything he did.
- Just over three months ago, without warning, Doru announced a crusade against Castle Ravenloft, which he proclaimed would free Barovia from the mists and return sunlight to the valley. Over two dozen young Barovians accompanied him, as well as a scholar from distant lands named Alanik Ray, who had been staying as a guest at Ismark and Ireena's home for the previous several weeks while studying Barovian history and ecology.
- Ireena doesn't recall much about Alanik, other than that he was a curious, somewhat intense man who kept to himself, took long walks into the Svalich Woods, and owned a pet monkey. She does remember, however, that he had a furious argument with Doru at one point, which confused her when he accompanied Doru to Castle Ravenloft shortly thereafter.

## Bildrath on the Seige of Barova
- Just over three months ago, a pack of would-be "revolutionaries" marched off to Castle Ravenloft to "slay the vampire." Doru, the son of Father Donavich, the village priest, "filled their heads with fairy tales" of banishing the Mists and bringing the Sun back to Barovia.
- None of the revolutionaries ever came back. A few days later, a dusk-skinned elf came to the village and announced that the village had ninety days to make peace with the gods before the lord of Castle Ravenloft—now awoken after a hundred years of slumber—exacted penance for their disobedience.
- Some villagers left. Many others wanted to leave. However, Ismark delivered a resounding speech in the village square before the statue of Ismark the Great, promising the villagers that those who remained would stand and defend their homes. "The audacity of the bastard," Bildrath sneers. "Standing in front of his great-grandfather's statue like he was worth a tenth of him."
- Bildrath wanted to leave—but his sister, Marta, and her husband, Dragomir, chose to stay with their son, Parriwimple, inspired by Ismark's words. Unwilling to leave his family, Bildrath stayed as well. "They figured they'd fight to defend what's theirs," he chokes out, blinking back tears. "Bloody idiots should've run, and never looked back."
- Ninety days after the elf delivered his proclamation, the undead came, swarming in hordes dozens strong from the Svalich Wood. The villagers fought back, defending the streets with barricades, swords, and arrows. "But the dead kept coming," Bildrath croaks. "And Marta—" He falls silent. (Bildrath lost Marta and Dragomir in the attacks, and blames Ismark for his failure to protect them, which left Parriwimple—Bildrath's nephew—an orphan.)
- When he's regained his composure, Bildrath warns the players that the village is doomed, and likely all of Barovia with it. "There's no sun to bring back," he spits. "No escape from the mists. This is Hell, now and for all eternity. The sooner you lot accept that, the better off you'll be."
- 
## Doru & Van Richten
- As a child, Doru was enraptured by stories of the sun and the light and hope that it once brought to the valley. As he grew older, he learned swordsmanship from Ismark and studied the book Van Richten’s Guide to Vampires to learn how to destroy the undead. He dreamed of one day destroying the Devil of Castle Ravenloft and bringing freedom to his people.
- Sixteen weeks ago, a foreign scholar calling himself Alanik Ray arrived in Barovia and rented a room in the burgomaster's manor. When an enormous undead dire wolf attacked a group of children who had strayed too far from the village, however, Doru alone saw "Alanik" fend it off with expert skill—and when the wolf knocked the hat off of "Alanik's" head, his appearance magically changed, revealing him to be the legendary vampire hunter Dr. Rudolph van Richten.
- Doru confronted him and insisted that Van Richten lead the village in revolt against Castle Ravenloft. Though Van Richten was reluctant at first, he eventually agreed—on the condition that Doru allow him to keep his disguise. Two days later, Doru, aided by a man named Escher—the village bard and Doru’s oldest friend—had assembled more than two dozen fighters to march on the keep.
- With Van Richten’s aid, the mob struck down any undead guards that tried to stand in their way. However, when they finally opened Strahd’s crypt, Escher was nowhere to be found—and Strahd’s coffin was empty. (If asked, Doru forcefully denies that Escher betrayed them.)
- Shortly thereafter, Strahd emerged from the shadows and attacked the mob with merciless force. Most of Doru’s companions were slain. Doru himself was turned into a vampire spawn, and later learned that Escher had been as well. Doru doesn’t know what happened to Van Richten, but was forced to confess the old man’s identity when Strahd interrogated him later.
- Doru spent nearly three months at Castle Ravenloft, during which Strahd repeatedly forced him to drink the blood of his former companions. Two weeks ago, Strahd commanded Doru to return to the church and his father.
- Doru can’t disobey Strahd’s direct orders, and can feel his presence at all times. His vampiric bloodthirst is a constant distraction, and it’s difficult to control his predatory urges and instincts. When he first returned to the church, he was almost grateful that his father had locked him in the undercroft, where he couldn’t do any harm.
- Doru doesn’t know if his soul or body can be saved, but he’s kept his father’s holy symbol to remind him of his faith and family, and to steel his will against the addictions of his new form. If not for that, he suspects that he would have lost control days or even weeks ago. (Doru doesn’t know why Strahd allowed him to keep it, but suspects that Strahd viewed it as a form of ironic amusement.)
-  about his argument with "Alanik," Doru admits, shamefacedly, that he forced Van Richten to accompany his rebels to the castle, threatening to march on Castle Ravenloft with or without Van Richten's help. (An enraged Van Richten ripped out the preface of Doru's copy of Van Richten's Guide to Vampires—which Doru bought from a Vistani caravan ten years prior—in order to make a point. "He warned me that faith and books meant nothing in the face of true evil," Doru murmurs. "I should have listened." Doru isn't sure what happened to the rest of the book.)

## Stanimir's Tale
Stanimir fills his mouth with wine, then spits into the fire.
The flames turn from orange to green. As they dance and
sway, a dark shape appears in the bonfire's core.

"We come from an ancient land whose name is long
forgotten-a land of kings. Our enemies forced us from
our homes, and now we wander the lost roads."

The dark shape in the fire takes the form of a man being
knocked from his horse, a spear piercing his side.

Stanimir continues. "One night, a wounded soldier
staggered into our camp and collapsed. We nursed his
terrible injury and quenched his thirst with wine. He
survived. When we asked him who he was, he wouldn't
say. All he wanted was to return home, but we were deep
in the land of his enemies. We took him as one of our
own and followed him back toward his homeland. His
enemies hunted him. They said he was a prince, yet we
didn't give him up, even when their assassins fell upon
us like wolves."

Deep in the bonfire, you see the dark figure standing
with sword drawn, fighting off a host of shadowy shapes.

"This man of royal blood fought to protect us, as we
protected him. We bore him safely to his home, and he
thanked us. He said, 'I owe you my life. Stay as long as
you wish, leave when you choose, and know that you will
always be safe here."'

“The figure in the dancing fire vanquishes its final foe, then disperses in a cloud of smoke and embers.” 

## Eliza’s Tale 
“It is said that within each raven flutters a lost soul, and that each raven’s song tells a tale of ages past. They whisper, so listen closely.”

She takes a deep breath; when she speaks again, her voice is quiet, with an eerie, melodic quality to it.

“Sing, ravens, of Barovia, birthed from the mists and bathed in twilight. Sing of Lugdana, the Morninglord’s stalwart, dawn-touched foe to the deep-lurking dark. The Holy Symbol of Ravenkind, her radiant testament, the warrior’s beacon of faithful resolve.

“Sing, ravens, of Chernovog’s rise, named Green-God and Demon-Lord upon Yester Hill. Lugdana, gray-haired, weary of battle, her longsword and shield yet polished and ready. Guided through shadows, toward sacred ground, she clashed with the demon, their tempest-like dance.

“Sing, ravens, of Lugdana’s last fury, of Ravenkind’s token now blazing with light. The battle’s tide turning, a hero’s brave cry, a final onslaught with divinity’s grace. The Demon-Lord banished, the warrior now fell, the wound at her side gouged too deep to bear.

“Sing, ravens, of light’s final moments, a shadow descending from radiance on high. Sing of the angel, black-feathered and beaked, the Morninglord’s angel reclaiming its gift. The Symbol retaken, in ravens’ claws held.

“Sing, ravens; you are the keepers, the watchers, the tellers of stories untold. Sing, ravens, of Lugdana’s memory, the shadows that lurk, and heroes to come.”

## Arturi’s Tale
There once was a Fox, renowned for his wisdom and skill, who dwelled with his kit in the misted woods. On a cold, moonlit night, a pair of Sparrows brought him their child, the tendrils of Death clutching its shivering body. The Fox took the chick into his den, but for all his knowledge, he could not cure its ailment, and it breathed its last in his paws.

Driven mad in their grief, the vengeful Sparrows, aided by four of their kin, stole the Fox's kit in the night. They delivered him to the Wolf, who had long hungered for the taste of fox-flesh. The Wolf devoured the kit, and the Sparrows departed to return to their flock.

When the Fox found what the Sparrows had done, rage clutched his own heart. In his cunning, he knew that the Rats, in their burrows beneath the earth, had always despised the songs of the Sparrows far above. The Fox descended to the kingdom of the Rats, and he promised them a forest free of the songs of the Sparrows. Intrigued, the Rats agreed.

The Rats could not find the Sparrows' nest alone. But the crafty Fox could, and as the Sparrows slumbered in the hollow of a great oak, the Rats fell upon them to feast with tooth and claw. For the crimes of six, the flock perished, with nary an egg spared.

The misted wood is darkened, now, and the trees no longer sing with the songs of the Sparrows. But some say that the Rats hunt still—that a lone chick yet escaped their clutches, and that one day, they will find it, and gobble it up like the rest.

## Ireena’s Tale 
"When I was a child, my father took me and my brother to a vast, tranquil lake. I remember the sand beneath my bare feet, and the lapping of the waves against the shore.

"But then, something broke the silence—a low growl that echoed through the wind. As I turned, I saw a beast emerge from the fog: a wolf, far larger than any I'd ever seen. I still remember its eyes—yellow, cold, and hungry.

"My father screamed for me to run. I took off for the woods, and the wolf followed, its snarls echoing through the underbrush. I remember branches whipping against my face, thorns cutting at my feet as my legs burned and my breath grew ragged, but my fear drove me forward.

"It was only much later, when my heart had quieted in my chest and the wolf's footsteps had faded into silence, that I finally allowed myself to stop. By then, though, the woods were strange to me, and my father's shouts had faded.

"A heavy mist had descended around me, and shadowed shapes lurked in every corner. I stepped forward, one hand reaching fearfully into the fog—and a wolf made of mist leapt forth, its jaws opened wide to devour me. And then—everything went black.

"The next thing I remembered, I awoke in my own bed, my father's humming echoing from the kitchen. I don't know how I got there, or what became of the wolf, but I can still remember its teeth as clearly as ever."

## Kasmir & the Dusk Elves
- Even now, nearly five centuries past, the memories are sharp and clear in my mind, like shards of broken glass. I was a mere century old when my people lost their freedom—when the tyranny of the von Zarovich clan rose like a shadow across the land.
- It was not Strahd that shattered the peace, but his father, King Barov von Zarovich II. In those days, our people dwelled in Othrondil, the Forest of Twilight. A council of princes ruled us, led by Erevan Löwenhart, my uncle and a master in the art of bladesong. When King Barov's eyes fell upon our lands, he demanded our fealty—our tribute to the borders of old Zarovia, the kingdom his ancestors once ruled. Erevan, who practiced the style of the lion and bore the lion's sigil, was never one to bow, however, and refused. His act of defiance ignited the fires of war.
- Barov's conquest was swift and brutal. His forces, joined by Rahadin, my cousin, and a traitor to our people, laid waste to our kingdom. I was a mage and scribe in Erevan's court—I saw Rahadin shatter Erevan’s blade and execute his family, marking the end of the royal line. My people were subjugated; those that resisted were hunted like rabbits.
- Barov ruled over us with an iron fist—and when he died and his son, Strahd, came to power, we rose in rebellion, leading the charge for freedom. But Strahd was even more cunning and cruel than his sire. He quashed our revolt in a matter of days, and slaughtered our people in a genocide that left less than a hundred alive. He left us, the survivors, to the mercies of the Vistani, who took us into their caravans and led us to sanctuary in this valley.
- Strahd's hunger for conquest, however, was endless. Within a year, the last of his enemies had fallen, and he had claimed the valley for his own, naming it "Barovia." We found ourselves trapped, imprisoned in the heart of our conqueror's new empire. By then, however, we had built a home here, and chose to remain—hoping, in our heart of hearts, that the Vistani's kindness would keep us safe. And so here we have remained ever since.

## Lady Wachter on Izek Strazni
- Izek was orphaned at the age of ten, losing his younger sister and arm in a wolf attack, and both of his parents to grief not long thereafter. His sister’s body was never found.
- Izek was often mocked for his disability, but after several of his tormentors went missing, the laughter abruptly stopped. No bodies were ever found, but rumors persist that Izek—a large and frequently violent child—murdered them himself.
- Approximately a year after losing his parents, Izek was arrested by the town guard and brought to the Vallakovich mansion. No one knows what crime he committed or why he was released soon thereafter, but Valentin Vallakovich’s twenty-five-year-old son, then-Baronet Vargas Vallakovich, all but adopted Izek and took him into their home.
- Izek served the Vallakovich family faithfully for the next five years. When Izek was sixteen, he somehow obtained a new arm to replace the one he had lost—though his new limb more resembled a devil’s than any human form. (Curiously, the day that Izek regrew his arm came the same day that Baron Valentin Vallakovich was announced to have passed in his sleep. Lady Wachter is confident that the two events are connected.)
- Izek’s fiendish arm allowed him to wield a proper weapon—but, more significantly, magically gave him the power to conjure fire. Vargas soon put both of Izek’s skills to work, designating Izek his personal enforcer and a ranking member of Vallaki’s town guard. As time passed, Izek became a terror throughout Vallaki, committing wanton acts of battery, arson, and extortion both at the Baron’s command and to serve his own diabolic whims.
- Many of the townsfolk hate and fear Izek—a sentiment that has slowly spread to Vargas as well in the wake of Strahd’s revival. However, Izek’s strength protects them both, swiftly dispatching any person who dares defy them, and intimidating those that don’t.

## Khazan's Tower
- Long ago, Khazan built a wizard’s tower, which he imbued with powerful enchantments, including a protective field that prevented any other spellcasters from using magic within its reach.
- ![Khazan's Ring](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/7db64b11c71d88572ddc6cd06b888976/images/Khazan's%20Ring.png)<br>
  The symbol on the signet ring resembles the connected series of lines depicted on the Tower Door, but rotated counterclockwise such that the shape is vertically symmetrical. A tiny arcane rune has been carved into the metal above each of the two unconnected ends of the series of lines.<br>
Kasimir notes that the runes are the symbols of the evocation (left) and necromancy (right) schools of magic, respectively, but confesses that the ring has shown no reaction to any kind of magic.
-  ![Tower Door](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/7db64b11c71d88572ddc6cd06b888976/images/Tower%20Door.png)<br>
  The tower door is made of iron, with no visible handles or hinges. In the middle of the door is a large, embossed, blank red seal. Carved into the lintel above the door is a word: Khazan.<br> The seal appears to be blank. However, if a character approaches within 5 feet of the door, eight fist-sized buttons grow from its waxlike surface. If the character then moves away from the door, the buttons vanish once more. The buttons emerge in different places each time, but the order of the buttons as they move around the seal always stays the same.<br>Each of the eight buttons depicts a different arcane rune. Vix identified the runes as the symbols of the eight schools of magic. The order of the symbols, moving counterclockwise around the seal, is always: illusion, abjuration, necromancy, conjuration, divination, enchantment, transmutation, evocation.
- comparing the platinum signet ring to the symbols  you noticed that the evocation and necromancy runes exactly match the appearance of their corresponding symbols on the door. To unlock the door, you pressed the buttons in the order given by the pattern of crossed lines on the signet ring, beginning with either the evocation or necromancy symbol and moving along the lines in the proper sequence.<br> The two possible proper sequences are:<br>
    --  evocation, divination, illusion, transmutation, conjuration, abjuration, enchantment, necromancy<br>
    --  necromancy, enchantment, abjuration, conjuration, transmutation, illusion, divination, evocation<br>

## Van Richten's recent history
When Van Richten first arrived in Barovia, he hoped to face Strahd alone, taking advantage of the vampire’s hibernation to destroy him in his coffin.

His plans were foiled when an undead dire wolf attacked a trio of Barovia children, and the resulting battle revealed his identity to the onlooking @LORE[.Xb2MFmwhjcjv9ghq]{Doru}.

Doru blackmailed Van Richten into leading a full-scale revolt on the castle, threatening to bring an untrained mob to Ravenloft’s doors if Van Richten didn’t lead them there. Van Richten, fearful that such a mob could awaken Strahd and destroy his own plans, reluctantly agreed.

Shortly after entering the castle, however, they were betrayed. @LORE[.5vbu6w2lyqWaj8Bv]{Escher}, Doru’s “lieutenant,” vanished from the group as they explored the catacombs. Not long thereafter, the mob found Strahd’s coffin empty—and Strahd himself attacked shortly thereafter. Van Richten fled, knowing from his long studies of Strahd that victory was impossible.

Upon escaping Castle Ravenloft and recovering his horse, Van Richten began the journey to warn the Barovians of the vampire’s awakening. However, he was stopped by the Vistani seer @LORE[.27g71hSFbmLqlbN9]{Madam Eva}, who warned him: ***“The message you bring shall be borne by another. Should you return to the village while light lingers in the valley, you shall surely meet your grave.”***

Knowing full well of Eva’s reputation, Van Richten reluctantly set forth for Lake Baratok instead, weeping bitter tears for the sons and daughters of Barovia.

Until recently, he had been laying low in the tower at Lake Baratok. However, that changed when he saw a Vistana man bringing a wriggling sack to a golden-haired vampire spawn on the banks of the Luna River. (Van Richten recognized the vampire as a man named Escher, a bard from Barovia who had joined the Barovians’ revolt.)

Van Richten attacked the pair, killing the Vistana and scarring the vampire, who fled. Upon opening the sack, he found a young Vistana girl within.

The girl, who introduced herself as @LORE[.VZhIrUIKNNw4b2ck]{Arabelle}, was uncertain of why she had been kidnapped. Van Richten used his talisman of echoes to interrogate the dead Vistana’s severed head, and learned that Strahd had issued a bounty on young girls matching Arabelle’s precise and unique description: dark-haired and olive-skinned, with lavender irises. Van Richten and Arabelle agreed that returning her to the Vistani camp would leave her exposed to Strahd, and was therefore too dangerous.

The two returned to the @LORE[JournalEntry.OqiPpgOGgup2xDvE.JournalEntryPage.LWF9WDRxSEOzZ2M4]{tower at Lake Baratok}, where Van Richten had previously hidden his horse, Drusilla, and a covered Vistani wagon that he had first used to enter Barovia. Using his hat of disguise, Van Richten adopted the dead Vistana’s guise and snuck into the Vistani camp by Vallaki to steal three pots of paint, which he used to disguise his wagon as “Rictavio’s Carnival of Wonders.”

Van Richten and Arabelle then traveled to Vallaki, with Van Richten adopting the identity of @UUID[.0YMdcl1PMe50UBTa]{Rictavio} to hide in plain sight. Arabelle has remained concealed in his wagon ever since.

While the tower at Lake Baratok contains a permanent antimagic field that would block Strahd’s scrying, Van Richten believed that Strahd would be well-aware of this fact, and that the tower would therefore be among the first places he looked. 

As such, Van Richten, who already wore one such amulet, gave Arabelle a spare amulet of proof against detection and location that he had once given to—and then received from—one of his students.

## Arabelle's Prophecy
In darkest night, the light shall flee,<br>
No dawn to break, with no reprieve.<br>
From the grave, the dead shall climb,<br>
Their restless march a baleful sign.<br>
At castle’s peak, a heart beats red,<br>
Its hunger deep and ever-fed.<br>
Should silence fall, the skies shall crack,<br>
A thousand souls in torment black.<br>

## Baba Lysaga's Scrying of Illya Krezkov:
“I see a boy,” she hisses, “adolescent, shaggy-haired, and claw-scarred.” Her voice is a mixture of intrigue and mockery, and she licks her lips in obvious amusement. “They have collared him with silver, and chained him to a post. There he sits, huddled and pathetic. His eyes, oh, they are hidden, buried in his knees as he snivels and sobs.”

She frowns, as if concentrating, and her voice drops to a rasping whisper. “The post is in a cavern—a dismal chamber lit by flickering torchlight. There is a woman chained beside him, sharp-eyed and with long, shaggy hair. I smell the gift of Mother Night on her. Nearby, I see a statue of a woman, wolf-headed—an idol to Mother Night, adorned in garlands and surrounded by a bounty of treasure. Rotting corpses kneel before her, bent to her majesty.”

## Lady Wachter on the Forest Folk and Strahd
- The individual was a druid of the Forest Folk, a loose society of hermits that dwell amidst the Svalich Woods and generally shun the civilized settlements. The druids treat Yester Hill, a hill at the southwest edge of the Barovian valley, as a sacred place, and worship Strahd as a deity for his control over the land and weather.
- Lady Wachter first encountered and learned of the druids while a student of her mentor, Lysa. Lysa, a woodswitch who dwelled in the swamps of Berez, was a worshipper of Mother Night, a deity of darkness, trickery, and the occult. Lady Wachter was never able to hear the “voice” of Mother Night (as Lysa called it), however, and adopted the faith of Ezra soon after returning to Vallaki.
- Lysa did not take Lady Wachter’s departure lightly. A prideful woman, she considered her students her children, and took Lady Wachter’s decision to return to Vallaki as a personal betrayal. Lady Wachter has been banished from Berez ever since.
- Lady Wachter’s “debt” to Strahd arises from his effort to save Lady Wachter’s ancestor, Lady Lovina Wachter, from death at the hands of the traitor Leo Dilisnya centuries ago. When a traitor and assassin named Leo Dilisnya murdered Lovina’s husband and attempted to kill Lovina as well, Strahd defended her, then hunted Dilisnya down to punish him for his treachery. House Wachter has remained loyal to Strahd ever since.

## Morgantha's Secrets
- Strahd’s most carefully guarded secret is a temple of forbidden lore hidden in the mountains. It is known as the Amber Temple, and it is the place where he first met the entity with which he forged his terrible pact. (Morgantha doesn’t know the temple’s location or the nature of Strahd’s pact.)
- Strahd von Zarovich seeks to escape from the grasp of the Mists. He has prepared a dark and secret plot to do so, harnessing the power of three ancient shrines to defy the will of the Dark Powers that rule this land. (Morgantha doesn’t know the specifics of his plot or the nature of the shrines, but knows that one of the three shrines is located among the circle of standing stones located at the base of the windmill’s hill.)
- Unbeknownst to Strahd, a traitor lurks in his midst: his eldest wife and vampire spawn Sasha Ivliskova. (Morgantha is wildly amused by this treachery, and has taken no action to warn Strahd of her conflicted loyalties.)

## Lady Wachter & Leo Dilisnya
- When Lady Wachter was a young woman, her parents and brother were killed in a mysterious incident that left their bodies apparently unharmed. Lady Wachter was the sole survivor, having been away from Wachterhaus at the time of the killing.
- When she returned to Wachterhaus, she determined that a malevolent spirit had been responsible for her family’s death. Though the spirit appeared to have departed by the time Lady Wachter returned, she was wary of the prospect that it might one day return.
- Using magic that she had learned from her mentor, Lysa, Lady Wachter erected a protective barrier around Wachterhaus that would prevent any creature within the Ethereal Plane from crossing over the boundary of the property.
- Leo Dilisnya, a guard of Castle Ravenloft. When Strahd killed his brother, Sergei, and pursued Sergei’s bride, Tatyana, through the castle gardens, it was Leo who gave the order for the guards to kill Strahd to defend Tatyana and avenge Sergei’s death.
- When Strahd became a vampire, he slaughtered his castle guards in a bloody and gruesome massacre. Lady Lovina Wachter née Dilisnya, Leo’s sister and a faithful devotee of Strahd von Zarovich, directed her bodyguards to assist Strahd in the bloodshed.
- Leo himself barely escaped, and hid himself away in the deserted Abbey of Saint Markovia on a spur of Mount Baratok. However, Strahd and Lovina eventually found him—and when they did, they turned him into a vampire spawn and sealed him in a lightless stone vault beneath Wachterhaus.
- They left him there to starve for four hundred years, slowly growing mad as the bloodthirst destroyed his mind and his hatred sharpened and burned. (“Do you have any idea what that’s like?” the gallows speaker snarls, the faces within its cloak moaning with a chorus of mournful wails. “Feeling your sanity slip away, year by year, as the hunger within you twists and grows, never to be sated?”)
- More than thirty years ago, Leo finally died, his spirit arising as a ghost that reunited with the tormented spirits of the castle guards, forming a gallows speaker. As he lurked unseen among Wachterhaus, he came to learn that he had been granted the release of death on the same night that Fiona Wachter—then a teenager—had fled her family estate, destroying an enchanted ruby gemstone that Strahd had given Lovina’s family as security should Leo ever escape.
- Not long after his death, Leo killed the Wachters that remained at Wachterhaus, but was unable to finish the job when Fiona Wachter sealed him out. Now, however, Leo seeks to “rip out the poisoned Wachter family tree, root and branch,” and finally “see justice done.”
- In life, Leo was an assassin of the Ba’al Verzi who betrayed his order’s vows when he sought to kill Strahd in vengeance for the death of his brother, Reinhold, who Strahd knowingly sent to die to win a battle against the Order of the Silver Dragon.
- On the morning of Sergei’s wedding, Leo climbed to the window of Strahd’s royal chambers, carrying with him a cursed Ba’al Verzi dagger that prevented its victims from being resurrected.
- When Lovina Wachter’s bodyguards engaged the castle guards to defend Strahd, it was Leo who gave the order to have the Wachters themselves killed, furious that his sister had elected to “betray” him and Reinhold’s memory.

## Muriel on the mountain and forest folk
the Mountain Folk—a tribe of hunter—gatherers that live amongst the Balinok Mountains—and that their people are neither servants of Strahd nor dangerous unless attacked. 

Muriel doesn’t know why the woman was watching the road, but shares that the Mountain Folk have been more active lately, though no one is quite sure why. Reports suggest that they’re looking for something, however. (If asked how she knows so much about the Mountain Folk, Muriel laughs and claims only that she’s well-traveled and has “many friends" across the valley.)

she shares that the Forest Folk are known to be loyal servants of Strahd, who they worship like a deity. She advises the players to steer clear of the druids’ lair: a terraced mound called Yester Hill in the southwest corner of the Svalich Woods, south of the Wizard of Wines.

## Revenant on the Forest Folk
Forest Folk of Yester Hill have been increasingly agitated as of late, and that they have been joined by the children of the Gulthias Tree—a twisted husk that grows atop Yester Hill and gives birth to “blights" that crawl forth from its gnarled roots. The revenant advises them to be wary of the blights, which see without eyes and disguise themselves among the flora of the wilds.

## Revenant on the Mountain Folk
the “First People" were split long ago in the face of tragedy and strife, and that their descendants remained apart ever since. It notes that the Forest Folk have embraced Strahd von Zarovich as their lord and ruler, but that the Mountain Folk still hold to the old ways, worshipping ancient goddesses that once dwelled in the valley. (The revenant doesn’t know where the Mountain Folk dwell, but has heard that their settlement is hidden somewhere in the mountains.)

## Dag on Urwin and Davians rift
Ten years ago, someone stole something valuable from the winery while Urwin Martikov was keeping watch. Davian blamed Urwin for the theft, convinced that he’d been fooling around with his betrothed, Danika Dorakova, instead of paying attention. Davian and Urwin had a furious fight the following morning, which ended with Urwin departing the winery for Vallaki. Urwin hasn’t returned since, and Davian never recovered the thing that was stolen, nor did he ever find the culprit. (If asked what was stolen, Dag says only that it was a gemstone—a prized family heirloom, and one of Davian’s most treasured possessions.)

## Dag on Elric and the Rebellion
- Just over three months ago, Elric Martikov, Elvir’s twin brother and Muriel’s betrothed, joined a rebellion in the village of Barovia that marched on Castle Ravenloft. Elric had always been bright-eyed and optimistic—a dreamer who believed in a better future for his loved ones. Davian forebade him from going, and ordered Elric never to return when he disobeyed. Davian’s words came true—Elric died in the castle, and his death shattered the Martikov family once again.
- Claudiu was especially close to his two youngest uncles, and Elric most of all. He and Elvir haven’t taken Elric’s death well, with both falling into a kind of melancholic despair and Elvir lashing out at anyone who gets on his bad side.

## Lorgoth on Lysaga
- The Forest Folk have come from Yester Hill to the south, which lies beside the Whispering Wall. (The Whispering Wall is largely as described in Y5. Wall of Fog, except that the ancient god that created the Wall was female.)
- The Forest Folk worship Strahd von Zarovich as a god, whom they call “the Shadowed Lord." The ravens of the winery and their masters, whom the Forest Folk call “the feathered ones," are old enemies of Strahd and his servants.
- The Forest Folk have come to “claim what is theirs"—ancient magic that the “feathered ones" stole from the druids’ ancestors long ago. To this end, they have allied with the “witch of the swamp," whose flying servants are called “strix," and whose children call her the “Mother of Darkness." They have also allied with a woman they call the “Child of Blood," whose mastery of magic has given them new power over the Gulthias tree and its spawn. (Lorghoth is referring to Baba Lysaga and Ludmilla Vilisevic, respectively.)
- The dead tree is a cutting of the Gulthias tree, which grows atop Yester Hill. Soon, nurtured by the Gulthias staff, it will grow to rival its parent, and give birth to blights of its own.
- Tomorrow at dawn, the mighty Wintersplinter will march from Yester Hill and reduce the winery to rubble, turning it into mulch to feed the young Gulthias tree. (Lorghoth won’t say who or what Wintersplinter is, except to cackle “Wintersplinter comes, and all will crumble in his wake!")

## Davian's confession
- The Forest Folk didn’t attack merely because they are “bad neighbors." Davian and his family are members of the Keepers of the Feather—a secret society dedicated to aiding those who oppose Strahd von Zarovich and his servants. The Keepers of the Feather, which aim to guide and shelter others rather than fighting Strahd directly, uses ravens as their messengers and spies.
- Davian is the leader of the organization, and all of his children are also members. (Davian can confirm that Muriel Vinshaw and Urwin Martikov are also members of the Keepers of the Feather, as well as a number of other Barovians scattered across the valley.)
- Just over three months ago, one of Davian’s youngest sons—Elvir’s twin brother, Elric—planned to travel to Castle Ravenloft to join the revolt against Strahd. Davian forebade it, reminding Elric that the Keepers of the Feather were spies, not fighters, and that joining the rebellion openly could compromise the secret of their existence. Elric defied him and joined the revolt anyway.
- Elric died in Castle Ravenloft. Not long thereafter, Baba Lysaga’s scarecrows and the druids of Yester Hill—often accompanied by a mysterious, dark-skinned woman—began staging attacks against the winery. 
- The Winery’s best-kept secret is the source of its wine: three green gemstones the size and shape of pinecones enchanted with plant-growing magic. Since its founding, the Martikovs have used these gemstones to grow three vintages of wine: Champagne du le Stompe, Red Dragon Crush, and Purple Grapemash No. 3. 
- However, ten years ago, the gemstone producing the Champagne du le Stompe was stolen. Davian doesn’t know who stole it, but blames Urwin for failing to keep watch. Although Urwin claimed to have seen an old woman in the fog with a raven perched upon her shoulder, and the same raven carrying the gem away shortly thereafter, Davian has never believed his story—largely because the Keepers of the Feather know all of the ravens in the valley.
- Three weeks ago, Baba Lysaga’s scarecrows uncovered and stole the second gem, depriving the winery of the means of producing Red Dragon Crush. Five days ago, the Forest Folk attacked and stole the third gem, preventing the Martikovs from producing Purple Grapemash No. 3. The Keepers staged an attack on Yester Hill in an attempt to reclaim it, but were easily driven back. (“We’re spies," Davian notes mournfully, “not warriors.")
- The druids returned two days later, now joined by a small army of corrupted blights, and drove the Martikovs out. (Davian had never seen the Forest Folk command the blights of the Gulthias Tree before, and hadn’t known it to be possible.) 
- According to snippets of conversation that his family overheard before they were driven out of the winery, Davian believes that the druids have been searching for the first enchanted gem—the one stolen ten years prior. (Davian isn’t sure why the druids are searching for it, or how they came to know of it.)

## Kavan on the Forest Folk
- The druids of the Forest Folk have been more active lately, gathering berserkers from the northern basin and leading blights of the Gulthias Tree down to the lands below. They appear to have obtained a new leader: a dark-skinned woman clad in a white gown and a golden tiara, with piercing eyes and a pair of sharp fangs. Kavan believes her to be a mage, having seen her conjure strange lights and sounds. (This is Ludmilla Vilisevic, one of Strahd’s vampiric brides.)
- Recently, the Forest Folk of Yester Hill—which Kavan’s people once called Sarmizeget—obtained something both new and yet incredibly old: an enchanted gemstone once belonging to Kavan's people that he thought lost long ago. The Forest Folk have constructed an enormous effigy of wood and earth atop the hill, within the great stone circle that serves as their meeting place, and placed the gemstone within the statue’s chest.
- Some of the Forest Folk appear to be preparing to instill the power of the gemstone within the statue, which is woven from the roots of the Gulthias Tree that grows atop Yester Hill. The ritualists have bonded themselves to the tree’s bloodthirsty roots, and plan to harness the power of the eternal storm above Yester Hill to give life to the being within the statue.
- The Gulthias Tree is a dark and corrupted entity, and an accomplice to the druids’ will. Kavan warns them that the tree might attempt to obstruct their efforts, but informs them that radiance burns it and slows its new growth. He notes that the tree thirsts especially for cursed blood, which strengthens and restores it.
- There are more than a dozen druids and berserkers now atop Yester Hill, though more have been arriving every day. They appear to be waiting for the one they call the “Shadowed Lord"—the lord of the fortress to the east. (Kavan is referring to Strahd von Zarovich and Castle Ravenloft.)

## Strahd on Kavan
"Long before my time, in the centuries before it came under my protection, Barovia was ruled by a different kind of darkness. His name was Kavan, warlord of the Mountain Tribes, and he swept forth from the Balinok Mountains like a raging storm to slaughter all who stood in his path. They called him Blood-Drinker, for the cursed spear he carried and his own, terrible thirst.

"Kavan, you see, was not of my kin. He was something far worse—a man of mortal lusts and ambitions. He drank the blood of his victims and buried himself beneath the red-stained soil when he slept, bathing in their terror and pain."

"His reign, though it lasted no longer than his lifetime, was an era of bloody excess—a testament to the depths of human brutality." Strahd's smile is thin and sharp, like broken glass. "Remember his tale as you walk these lands, for the echoes of the past never leave us, and the blood Kavan spilled still stains these hallowed hills."

## Ludmilla on Wereravens
- Three months ago, when Doru's rebellion awoke Strahd from his slumber, there was a raven among them—but no ordinary raven. It seemed to possess an intelligence far beyond any ordinary beast.
- Strahd took the raven captive, and when Ludmilla returned to the castle—"to my Lord's service"—she was granted permission to investigate its properties. She soon found that the raven swiftly regenerated any wounds dealt to it, even those that seemed to be mortal—except those inflicted by silver or necrotic magic. She surmised that she had discovered a wereraven—a mythic counterpart to the wolfish lycanthropes that ranged in packs across the Barovian valley.
- With her research completed, Ludmilla moved to vivisect the creature, aiming to uncover any final hidden attributes. "It shrieked and squealed like a pig," she notes coldly, "but fortunately, the silver of its restraints burned it too fiercely for it to even contemplate the possibility of escape." (If Muriel is with the players, she begins to tremble, her hand curling tightly around the hilt of her shortsword until her knuckles turn white.)
- When the raven finally expired, it reverted to the form of a man—seemingly proving Ludmilla's theory. Ludmilla took the body to Baba Lysaga—an old colleague and mentor of hers—in Berez. Through Baba Lysaga's guidance, she tracked the wereraven to a seditious and traitorous family that dwelled in the Wizard of Wines winery—the Martikov clan.
- Baba Lysaga vowed to see the wereravens dead, and Ludmilla brokered an alliance between her and the druids of Yester Hill, who were eager to bring the downfall of any who defied their "Shadowed Lord." 
- It was sheer luck that Baba Lysaga's scarecrows uncovered the source of the winery's fecundity—a pair of enchanted gemstones that the Forest Folk recognized as heirlooms stolen from their ancestors. The druids were, understandably, eager to reclaim their heritage from the feathered usurpers.

## Muriel's confession
- She, like all of the members of the Keepers of the Feather, is a wereraven—a lycanthrope cursed to assume the form of a raven beneath the light of the full moon. (If asked, Muriel can confirm that Elric Martikov was the Keeper who bestowed the curse upon her, and who initiated her into the Keepers of the Feather.)
- Her lycanthropy allows her to assume the form of a raven or a raven-humanoid hybrid, and provides her with regenerative abilities and flight, though silvered weapons are lethal to her. If she took damage from Ludmilla’s shroud of mist, she shares that certain kinds of dark magic appear to be lethal to her as well.
- Her betrothed, Elric Martikov, was a wereraven who accompanied Doru’s rebellion in raven form, seeking to provide guidance to the ramshackle mob. He never returned from Castle Ravenloft—evidently, because Ludmilla killed him.
- If she lost control and attacked Ludmilla, Muriel sincerely and shamefacedly apologizes for doing so. “Everything felt so far away," she says, quietly. “I thought I was going to lose myself, I was so angry." If the players brought her back to her senses, she is deeply grateful to them for doing so.

- the players ask Muriel to curse them with wereraven lycanthropy, she laughs softly, and apologizes for disappointing them. “Even if I gave it to you, you couldn’t control it—not without months of proper training," she tells them.  Muriel apologetically refuses to say anything further on the subject, though she is glad to reassure the players that her refusal doesn’t arise from a lack of trust.

## Strahd on the Whispering Wall
the Whispering Wall, the ancestors of the Forest Folk believed it to be the corpse or tomb of an ancient god, whose last exhalation of divinity produced this mist.

Strahd informs the players that these ancestors believed the Wall to offer visions of one's deepest desires, if one entered it as a pilgrim. "It is a powerful thing, to know oneself and one's desires," he says, adding softly. "and yet dangerous, as well." 

If asked whether he has stepped into the Wall himself, Strahd nods. If asked what he sees within the Wall, he shares that he sees a "white fortress above a great city, with a church bell ringing through the fog." 

Before giving the players their reward from winning Strahd's wager, Strahd asks them to complete one simple task: They must step into the Wall and view their deepest desires. "I will not ask what you see," Strahd promises. "One's desires are their own."

Strahd warns them, however, that many have become lost in the Whispering Wall, too entranced by its visions to depart. "It guides you forward, but you must leave under your own power," he says. "Remember: The way back will come but once."

Strahd promises that each player who enters the Wall and returns safely will receive an additional gift: a shard of the power of the Whispering Wall itself. (He won't say more than that.) He wonders aloud, however, whether they will have the strength of will to do so. "Lesser men often lose themselves to its illusions," he says, a taunting glint in his eye. "They trade life for dreams, and receive neither. They are lost to the mist, doomed to remain there for eternity."

## Kavan & the First Folk
Long ago, Kavan was a chieftain among the First Folk, whose people arrived in the valley long before Kavan’s own birth.

The First Folk worshipped a trio of goddesses known as the Rozana, or the Ladies Three: the Seeker, the Weaver, and the Huntress. The druids of the First Folk paid homage to the Ladies at their holy sites—three fanes that dwelled within the valley, known as the Mountain Fane, the Forest Fane, and the Swamp Fane. Each Fane held a gemstone imbued with the power of the Weaver, which was said to give life and vitality to the wilderness around it. "This wand," Kavan notes somberly, "was once wielded by those who connected our people to the Rozana."

Nearly one thousand years ago, Kavan came to power as chieftain of his tribe. Arrogant and proud, he defied his people’s strictures and ventured forth into the Whispering Wall, a wall of thick fog said to hold the corpse of the Devourer—an ancient monster that the Ladies killed long before.

While within the Wall, Kavan learned terrible secrets—including the means by which he could steal the Huntress’s sacred spear from the Forest Fane and claim its power for his own. Upon doing so, he waged war on the other tribes, reuniting them beneath his own banner. The servants of the Seeker, a clan of wereravens, hid away the life-giving gems that blessed the Fanes to conceal them from his ambitions, and vanished into the wilderness. (Upon saying this, Kavan gives Muriel a long, meaningful look, though he cannot confirm whether she is spiritually descended from one of the original wereravens that served the Seeker.)

The druids of the First Folk condemned Kavan for his hubris, and retreated to the village of Soldav in the Balinok Mountains, their people’s most sacred site and the center of their faith. They named Kavan “enemy," and banished him from Soldav for his crimes. When he died, instead of burying him in a place of honor upon Yester Hill with the great chieftains of the past, the druids buried him here, in a lonely cairn far from the graves of his forefathers. Kavan has been haunted by his isolation from his people as a result ever since his death.

In Kavan’s ailing years, a tyrant named King Dostron the Hellborn invaded the valley with his army, scattering the First Folk and destroying their homes. He dammed up the Luna River to make farmland, and shattered the First Folks’ faith in the Ladies Three. When Dostron died, his armies withdrew and abandoned his fortress, but the First Folk remained apart and weak.

When Strahd invaded the valley hundreds of years later, many members of the druidic caste—still angered by Kavan’s betrayal and Dostron’s oppression—sought out his protection. A great schism split the First Folk, with those who opposed Strahd retreating to Soldav and those who favored Strahd remaining within the Svalich Wood. Today, Barovians know them as the Mountain Folk and the Forest Folk. The land of Barovia, which the First Folk once called “Girvisa"—meaning “fertile land"—has been corrupted by Strahd’s will and magic. Kavan doesn’t understand the nature of Strahd’s corruption, but he knows that Strahd draws power from the land, and that this profane connection causes great suffering to the creatures and landscape of the valley. To learn how to cleanse Strahd’s corruption, the players must travel to Soldav to seek the guidance of an elder of the faith of the Rozana among the Mountain Folk. (Only an elder of the faith of the Rozana can conjure and maintain the mist that shields Soldav from outsiders.)

Soldav is hidden somewhere in the Balinok Mountains, protected by a shroud of enchanted mist. So long as the mist remains, Soldav’s enemies can never find it, nor can they remember where it lies. Kavan remembers only the landmark that marks its entrance: a place in the mountains where two waterfalls run together. "Without a token of the Ladies, however," he warns, "you will never find the entrance, nor will Soldav's elders grant you entry."

## Origins of The Keepers of the feather
The Keepers were first founded by Livius Martikov, Davian’s grandfather and a little-known accomplice of the paladin Lugdana, who rooted out nests of vampire spawn across the valley using the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind one hundred years ago.

As a younger man, Livius helped Lugdana and Burgomaster Ismark Antonovich steal the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind—then called the Sigil of the Sun—from Castle Ravenloft shortly after Strahd began his hibernation. (Livius stole it, as well as the Tome of Strahd, from the depths of the catacombs while Ismark and Lugdana distracted Strahd’s servants and children.)

It was Ismark the Great who proposed renaming the Sigil to be the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind in order to inspire the Barovian people and conceal its origins, crafting a tale in which an angel in the shape of a raven delivered the relic to Lugdana directly. (Livius always found the tale incredibly amusing.) Lugdana would continue to wield the Holy Symbol until her death fighting the Green God Chernovog, a greater demon conjured by the mad witch Baba Zelenna, atop Yester Hill. The Holy Symbol was thought lost when Lugdana fell—seemingly for good.

## Muriel's overheard prophecy involving Strahd.
"The Darklord—the master of shadows, the beast in the labyrinth that tears at his chains.<br>
"The Six of Stars, the Evoker—the power you covet, a force untamed by mortal hands, raw and wild with burning fury.<br>
"The Artifact—the token you seek, the key to power. Divinity’s heart waits, but where?<br>
"The Innocent. I see a maid of raven hair and twilit eyes. She is one way to the token.<br>
"But there is another—the Broken One. The path of sacrifice opens another door. The wall that whispers awaits your tribute."<br>

## Baron Krezkov on Krezk
- Residents never leave the village for fear of being attacked by wolves, dire wolves, and werewolves.
- Dmitri's sole two children are the thirteen-year-old Ilya and the eight-year-old Kala. Ilya recently went missing after a werewolf attack.
- About once a month, a wagonload of wine arrives from the Wizard of Wines, the winery and vineyard to the south. The business is owned and operated by the Martikov family.
- A pool at the north end of the village provides fresh water throughout the year. Next to the pool, the village's ancestors built a shrine to the Morninglord in a gazebo. It's known as the Shrine of the White Sun.
- The Abbey of Saint Markovia is named after a priest of the Morninglord who took a stand against the devil Strahd. After a fierce uprising, Markovia and her most loyal followers stormed Castle Ravenloft, only to be destroyed.
- The abbey was once a hospital and a convent, but it fell on hard times after the land was swallowed up by the mists. Some of the clergy fell prey to Strahd, while others went mad and either starved themselves to death or turned to cannibalism.
- The head of the abbey, called simply the Abbot, arrived over a century ago and hasn't aged a day since.
- He occasionally visits the Shrine of the White Sun but doesn't talk much, No one knows his true name or where he came from, and many believe he's Strahd's servant or the vampire himself in disguise.
- Dmitri's late grandfather once spoke of a time when the Abbot was kind and compassionate, and cared for the sick and suffering of Barovia. (Dmitri isn't sure whether he believes this or not.)
- No one from the village visits the abbey anymore. The abbey's bell rings at odd times, day and night, and the place is filled with baleful screams and horrible, inhuman laughter that can be heard throughout the village.

## Clovin on the Belviews
- Long ago, Clovin’s ancestors came to the Abbey seeking a cure for a strange and mysterious illness. The Abbot healed them by perfecting their bodies, giving them new parts and traits that elevated them beyond their former, pitiful condition.
- The Abbot’s work, however, is not yet finished. The Belviews patiently await the day when their “blessed perfection" shall be complete—a day that Clovin believes is fast approaching. (If asked why, Clovin says only that his father, Cyrus, has only recently been perfected. Clovin shares that he is confident his turn shall come next, given his own long-standing loyalty and service to the Abbot.)

## The Abbot on Strahd
- He serves as the Abbot of the Abbey of Saint Markovia in Saint Markovia’s honor, a position he has held for some years. He was sent to reopen the Abbey following its tragic fate and abandonment—to make it a place of healing and sanctuary once again. (If asked how many years he has served at the Abbey, the Abbot shares that he has held his position for one hundred and seventeen years, ten months, and twenty-six days—a trivially brief time, in his mind. The Abbot won’t share his true angelic nature or identity, noting simply and serenely that he is merely a humble servant of the Morninglord.)
- Twice has he had the opportunity to look into Strahd’s eyes—which, as it is said, are the windows to one’s soul. On the first occasion, he saw a man who ached with an unquenchable thirst to fill the void in his heart, like a parched desert longing for rain. On the second occasion, he realized that Strahd was cursed—a curse that clutched his very soul—that his soul was tied to the land itself, and that his ailment rendered the land barren and its people imprisoned. (If asked, the Abbot can share that the first occasion took place four hundred and seventeen years, eight months, and three days ago, and that the second took place one hundred and fifteen years, six months, and sixteen days ago. If asked how he met Strahd on the first occasion, the Abbot smiles serenely and states merely that the Morninglord’s service leads one on many paths.)
- The Abbot believes that filling the void in Strahd’s soul—which Strahd has filled uselessly with power, pride, and wealth—is necessary to heal the wound that afflicts the land of Barovia. Only love can fill such a void, however: the deep, abiding, and unconditional love that Strahd has been denied all his life.
- As an immortal, however, Strahd requires the companionship of a creature that will last for as long as he will. It is for this reason that the Abbot has constructed Vasilka: a flesh golem built to be the perfect bride to a man of power, stature, and noble descent. Unlike others of her kind, Vasilka was forged with a spark of life within her heart, allowing her to be the companion that Strahd so desperately needs.
- The Abbot has begun to train Vasilka in the arts of etiquette and romance. Given Strahd’s brilliant intelligence and his respect for creatures of similar intellect, the Abbot has also taught her philosophy, theology, and the natural sciences. Soon, the Abbot will offer her to Strahd as his bride—and when they are wed, the Abbot believes, the curse upon the land shall be lifted.
- The Abbot notes, however, with some concern, that his window of opportunity is fast drawing to a close. Although he cannot discern neither its true nature nor its manner or time of arrival, he can sense the approach of a great storm on the horizon—one that will soon alter Strahd’s fate forever.

## The Abbot on the Belviews
- Shortly after his arrival at the Abbey, a family suffering a debilitating, unwholesome disease, came to the abbey seeking salvation. Their hereditary condition, which struck in early adulthood, left its victims physically frail and prematurely aged in appearance.
- The Abbot could not heal their malady—a congenital disease, rather than a mere infection or wound—directly. However, he was able to ameliorate its effects through grafting the parts of beasts upon their ailing bodies, replacing blinded eyes with the eyes of a cat, arthritic knees with the legs of a dog, liver-spotted skin with the scales of a snake, or swollen feet with the hooves of a mule.
- The family’s illness, however, left their minds weak and vulnerable. The process, sadly, left their thoughts and emotions in a disturbed and unquiet state, requiring them to remain patients of the Abbey indefinitely, until their transformation could be perfected. The modern-day Belviews are their descendants. (The Abbot insists, if asked, that he is confident that he will one day find a cure for their condition.)

## The Abbot on St. Markovia
- Saint Markovia was of the same generation as Strahd von Zarovich—but where Strahd lived a life of steel and blood, Saint Markovia walked in grace beneath the light of the Morninglord.
- As a youth, Markovia followed her heart and became a priest of the Morninglord soon after her eighteenth birthday. She proved to be a charismatic proselytizer and, before the age of thirty, had gained a reputation for allowing no evil to stand before her.
- It was Tasha Petrovna, an oracle and cleric of the Morninglord, who, with the guidance of one of the Morninglord’s angels, elevated Saint Markovia as a new prophet of the Morninglord’s faith. Following internal strife with Saint Andral, the Most High Priest of the Morninglord’s church, however, Saint Markovia departed the Morninglord’s holy lands and built a new sanctuary in the quiet wilderness: the Abbey of Saint Markovia, which served as both a convent and hospital.
- Shortly after Strahd’s curse fell upon the valley, Saint Markovia gathered her followers and marched upon Castle Ravenloft. Strahd destroyed them all, and those who remained at the Abbey soon fell into madness and despair.

## Ezmerelda on herself and recent history
She is a Vistana, though she travels with no caravan.

Unbeknownst to the Krezkovs, she has come to the Abbey to learn the source of the Abbot's madness, and how it might be cured in order to save Anna Krezkov's life.

She arrived in Barovia herself just under two weeks ago via wagon. Since then, she’s remained largely in and around Krezk, though she left her wagon near the shore of Lake Baratok as a mobile base. She’s been searching the nearby woods for Ilya Krezkov, the missing son of Burgomaster Dmitri Krezkov and his wife, Anna. (“They saved me from the brink of death, once," she says, quietly. “I owe them at least that much.")

Since her arrival, she’s been disturbed by just how much Barovia has changed since she last visited—owing largely, it’s clear, to Strahd von Zarovich’s reawakening. (She narrows her eyes playfully, surveys the players, and notes, "With the lord of the castle up and about, I assume it's not difficult to fall under his sway. None of you have fangs or a thirst for my blood, I hope?")

Rather than traveling with a Vistani caravan, she hunts monsters—"old, dusty vampires included." (Ezmerelda shares this fact with a wry grin.)

She was trained by “the finest vampire hunter alive," a man whose name is so legendary that not even monsters dare go “bump" in the night upon hearing it. (Her boastful smile then fades, and she adds, quietly, “At least, if he’s still alive to speak it.")

Her mentor is Dr. Rudolph van Richten, the legendary vampire hunter. Three months ago, she and his other former students received a letter he’d sent announcing his intention to travel to Barovia.

As the sole Vistana among his students, only she was able to trace his path through the mists and track him to the valley. Upon her arrival, however, she learned from a traveling Vistani caravan that Dr. Van Richten was rumored to be dead, having fallen in battle in a failed rebellion at Castle Ravenloft.

She has come to the Abbey because Burgomaster Dmitri Krezkov told her that the Abbot appeared to be growing increasingly unstable, and that he feared for Krezk’s safety as a result.

Upon first visiting the Abbey, Ezmerelda—a weak clairvoyant—swiftly sensed that unquiet spirits lingered within its shadowed halls. She has intended to return ever since, planning to contact those spirits to further investigate the Abbot’s identity and the cause of his growing madness. (The chalk circle is meant to provide the medium for a seance, focusing the energies Ezmerelda must call upon and acting as a protective barrier against malevolent spirits.)

Three nights ago, she successfully found what she believes to be Ilya’s location: a cavern at the base of a spur of Mount Baratok along the northwestern shore of Lake Baratok. There’s one catch, however: Barovia’s werewolf pack uses the cave as its den, making any effort to rescue Ilya tremendously risky.

After capturing and interrogating a werewolf with the Barovian pack, Ezmerelda learned that the bulk of the pack will soon be departing Barovia to range beyond the Mists with Strahd's permission. The pack's expedition, Ezmerelda shares, will take place at dusk the following night. "My source didn't know how long the pack would be away," she notes. "It might be anywhere from twelve hours until twelve days, so we'll want to get in and out before dawn."

##### ***The Vision***
 ~~-------------------------~~   
A rush of ethereal wind sweeps through the room—and a radiant burst of light erupts from the center of the pentagram, painting the walls in shades of silver and gold.<br>
Flashes of images flicker across your mind's eyes:<br>
+ A white-robed woman kneeling before a man with wings as white as the purest snow, who directs a gold-robed woman to present her with a silver statuette of a cleric kneeling in supplication, its chest glowing with the same golden light that encircles that man's head. [humility]<br>
+ The white-robed woman, standing before a half-built structure atop a cold mountain spur, her hands calloused as she lays bricks upon a mortared wall. [hope]<br>
+ The same woman, raising a golden mace above her head, a prayer upon her lips as a shadowed fortress looms above her. [defiance]
+ The silver statuette, sitting alone in a dark, cold tomb beneath a dark, twisted keep. The man, alone on a mountaintop, a veil of mist shrouding his eyes. [sorrow ]<br>
Each image is accompanied by a surge of emotion: humility, hope, defiance, and sorrow so strong it rakes at your chest with long, bitter claws. But as quickly as they appeared—the visions fade, and when you open your eyes again, you find the room returned to its former state. <br>

## Baron Krezkov on recent history
- Recently, a werewolf attacked the village of Krezk, somehow managing to bypass its walls. In its rampage, it wounded many and killed Kala. (“I held her in my arms as she died," Dmitri sobs. “Half her side was missing. She kept whispering, ‘Daddy’ and ‘Mommy’ over and over again, until she finally fell still.")
- The Krezkovs’ son, Ilya, vanished in the chaos, and hasn’t been seen in days. (If the players located Ilya in Arc I - The Walls of Krezk, Dmitri adds that, until recently, they feared him to be dead as well.)
The Krezkovs prayed to the Morninglord for guidance and deliverance, begging for mercy and salvation—and the Abbot answered.
- The following morning, the Abbot’s bestial servants—a pair of creatures who called themselves Otto and Zygfrek—invited the mourning Krezkovs to the Abbey. There, the Abbot offered a bargain, promising to resurrect Kala in full health if Anna promised to sacrifice her heart to the Abbot’s foul creation: the flesh golem he calls Vasilka. To Dmitri’s horror, Anna accepted—and the Abbot brought Kala back to life.
- The Abbot gave Anna one month’s time to make peace with her family and neighbors—an act he called “the Morninglord’s mercy." The Krezkovs don’t have much time left. (The Abbot’s deadline expires two weeks and one day after the players’ first full moon in Vallaki.)
- Kala hasn’t been the same since her resurrection. Dmitri and Anna haven’t asked, but they’re terrified that she remembers the experience of dying—and that what she saw beyond the veil of mortality scarred her forever. The life and laughter have gone out of her, and she spends much of her time staring at the grave her parents once prepared for her.

## Kala on recent history
Her parents won’t tell her, but she thinks she died—and that the Abbot had something to do with her coming back. She doesn’t remember exactly what happened: only a flash of teeth and claws, and blood and pain.
Kala then remembers being somewhere dark, filled with mist and distant screams. “I felt like I was supposed to go somewhere," she mumbles, “but the mist stopped me. Every time I tried to leave, it brought me back into the screams and the darkness."
Eventually, she awoke once more into her body—healed and whole, without any more pain. Her parents took her home and lavished her with love and care, but Kala could tell that they were nervous and afraid, as if one wrong move could break her.
Kala has had nightmares ever since her resurrection—dreams of the monster that killed her, and of the dark place she went to when she died. She believes that confronting the monster will allow the nightmares to stop.

Kala informs the player that she had snuck outside to play in the garden on the night that she died—and that the monster came from the wine cellar beneath the house. She asks the player to wait until her parents are asleep, then bring her there and keep her safe, so that she can either see the monster for herself or confirm that it has gone forever.

## Baron Krezkov's Confession
- Eighty years ago, his grandfather was bitten by a werewolf. His ancestor survived, but the curse of lycanthropy remained with him until his death—and was passed down, intermittently, within the Krezkov line. The curse emerges on the first full moon after an infected Krezkov’s thirteenth birthday, transforming their body into a powerful, violent beast on that night and each full moon thereafter.
- Since then, the Krezkov family has kept the curse under control by binding themselves in silver on the nights of the full moon and imbibing a potion of wolfsbane, which keeps the spirit of the wolf docile and calm.
Dmitri was born a werewolf. When Ilya was born, his parents hoped that he might escape the curse—but as the night of his first full moon approached, the signs of lycanthropy were impossible to ignore. (The signs of lycanthropy, Anna can share, include sudden, uncharacteristic bursts of restlessness and aggression. sharpened senses of hearing and smell, an amber tinge to the irises, and a markedly increased appetite around the time of the full moon.)
- Anna prepared Ilya a potion of wolfsbane, and helped bind him to the shackles upon the walls beside his father. Somehow, however, when Ilya first transformed, the potion failed to suppress the rage or strength of the wolf inside. Ilya broke free of his shackles, escaped the cellar, and rampaged across the village—though not before wounding several of the villagers and killing his sister, Kala.
- Ilya then fled across the walls and vanished into the Svalich Woods. Despite arranging several search parties in the weeks since his disappearance, Dmitri and Anna have found no sign of him.
- Dmitri apologizes to the players for concealing this information from them, and notes his understanding if the players are frightened or upset.

## Sir Godfrey  on Argynvost & Strahd
Long ago, before the Mists descended upon the valley, the Order of the Silver Dragon was an order of knights dedicated to justice and the protection of the weak. The order was founded by Lord Argynvost—a man of great wealth, kindness, and valor. Only Godfrey and the remainder of Argynvost’s most trusted knights knew Argynvost’s deepest secret: that he was, in truth, a silver dragon in disguise. 

Not ten years after the Order first settled at Argynvostholt, Strahd von Zarovich brought war to the lands surrounding the valley. The Order ranged far afield to defend against Zarovich’s invading armies and shelter those made refugees by the violence, but ultimately found itself driven back to the valley and, ultimately, the mansion of Argynvostholt.

A great battle took place on the floodplain east of the mansion, and many of the knights of the Order were slaughtered. As Godfrey and his commander, Vladimir Horngaard, led a final sortie against the enemy general’s camp, both were killed as well—Commander Horngaard by Zarovich himself, and Godfrey by Zarovich’s second-in-command: a cruel-eyed dusk elf bearing twin scimitars. (If asked, Godfrey can confirm that the elf was Rahadin, the current chamberlain of Castle Ravenloft.)

Several years thereafter, Godfrey felt Commander Horngaard’s rage pull his soul from beyond the grave, and found himself and the other knights of the Order returned to life as undead revenants. He learned that Zarovich had desecrated Argynvost’s remains, burning the dragon's bones and taking his skull as a trophy to the new Castle Ravenloft—an act so foul it had stirred Horngaard to vengeful hatred even in death.

The revenant knights renewed the fight against Strahd, waging war for months—until the Mists descended upon Barovia. The knights marched on Castle Ravenloft, where the Vistani crone Madam Eva met them at the castle gates. She told them Strahd had died and been reborn, and that he and all Barovia were now captives of the Mists.

Commander Horngaard and the knights returned to Argynvostholt. There, Commander Horngaard, his heart still clutched by hate, forbade the members of the Order from fighting Zarovich, who Commander Horngaard believed deserved to suffer in his prison for all eternity. Later, Commander Horngaard expanded his interdiction to Strahd’s servants and creatures as well, believing that Strahd’s dark dominion would only drive him to deeper levels of pain and misery—for what was a conqueror without anything left to conquer?

The knights of the Order reluctantly obeyed Horngaard’s order, even as they watched the people of Barovia sink deeper into despair. As Strahd slumbered in his tomb, many among them came to believe that the Barovians’ nightmare may one day lift—until a knight came bearing news of a failed rebellion from the village of Barovia to the southeast, and Strahd’s threat to wipe the village and its people from the valley.

A great quarrel erupted, as the knights demanded the right to defend the village from Strahd’s vengeance. Commander Horngaard, angered by their defiance, banished the other knights from the mansion. Only Godfrey, restrained by his bindings, did Horngaard allow to remain.

Argynvost may have fallen in the war against Strahd, but his spirit still lingers at Argynvostholt. In the decades after the Mists first descended, the dragon’s spirit appeared to Commander Horngaard in flickering visions, urging him away from his path of hatred and vengeance. However, Horngaard never turned from his path, and Argynvost’s spirit gradually fell quiet, sinking into a silent, dormant slumber.

Shortly after Strahd awoke from his hibernation, Argynvost’s spirit began to stir again, though Godfrey doesn’t know why. The dragon’s spirit is too old and weak to manifest directly, but several of the other ghosts that haunt the mansion’s halls claim to have heard him whispering in his ethereal slumber, murmuring of a new generation of heroes, and a new and final front in the fight against darkness. When the knights of the order were banished from Argynvostholt, Godfrey sent them to seek out those who Argynvost might be searching for, and direct them toward the manor.

## Brother Marek on St. Markovia
- In life, he was the chaplain of the Order of the Silver Dragon. He perished defending the third-floor corridor when the forces of Strahd von Zarovich assaulted the mansion on the final day of the war.
- The stained-glass figure he is possessing is a depiction of Saint Andral, once the Moste High Priest of the Church of the Morninglord. The other two stained-glass figures are the angel Ithuriel and Saint Markovia, respectively. The stained-glass windows depict Saint Markovia’s anointment as a prophet of the Morninglord, in which Ithuriel placed a shard of his divinity in the icon he bestowed upon her.
- The players note Saint Andral’s apparent envy, Brother Marek agrees that many rumors once suggested that Saint Andral, who reinvigorated the Church’s power and reach after bestowing the crown of Old Zarovia upon King Barov von Zarovich II, was not pleased with the Morninglord’s decision to anoint Markovia instead of himself.

## Vladimir Horngaard on himself & Strahd
- In life, he was the commander of the Order of the Silver Dragon, the “valiant order" to which he devoted his life. He perished defending this valley from evil over four centuries ago; because of his failure, he is forever doomed.
- There is no monster Vladimir hates more than Strahd von Zarovich, an invader and tyrant who slew Argynvost and destroyed the Order of the Silver Dragon.
- Vladimir has forbidden his knights from killing Strahd or aiding his defeat because he believes Strahd must suffer eternally for his sins in a hell of his own creation, from which Strahd can never escape. “He sacrificed everything for his empire—faith, love, and youth," Vladimir growls. “Now, everything he ever wanted and everything he ever won is locked away beyond the mists, leaving him trapped in this land of ghosts." (Vladimir doesn’t know who or what the Dark Powers are, but believes that “dark powers" far greater than Strahd have seen fit to punish him for his crimes—a sentence that Vladimir is proud to uphold.)
- Because Strahd, a conqueror, craves adversaries to overcome, Vladimir has also forbidden his knights from slaying Strahd’s minions and creatures, a decision he believes will drive Strahd mad with boredom and despair. (If challenged with the suffering of the Barovian people, Vladimir snarls: “I would let a thousand nations burn if Strahd von Zarovich would choke on the ashes.")

## Bianca on Kiril
- She is an herbalist who lives in the woods nearby with her husband, Kiril. 
- She saw Ezmerelda’s wagon and was curious about its contents. Rather than open the door, she investigated further and found the trapdoor on its bottom, which she used to enter and explore its interior.
- She took the lyre and perfume because they reminded her of memories she had from long ago—"from before I met my husband." She took the scrolls because she has always been fascinated by books, but was disappointed when she proved unable to decipher them. 
- The song she was singing is titled “The Lunatic’s Lament," and is about a woman who falls in love with the moon and chases it off a cliff, ultimately falling to her death. After pausing for a moment, she adds, softly: "Have you ever fallen in love with someone, and wondered if you made a mistake?"
- the players ask about Bianca's husband, she is willing to share the following information:
- Thirteen years ago, Bianca was the daughter of a wealthy family. She forfeited her inheritance, however, when she fell in love with a brawny and strapping young logger named Kiril Stoyanovich. Against her parents' wishes, she fled from her comfortable life to live with him in a cottage in the nearby woods.
- While "the vampire" slept, the wilds were more peaceful—but ever since Strahd awoke, Kiril has been "haunted—not by any ghost, but by his own rage." (
- the players ask what Kiril is enraged by, Bianca states simply and soberly: "A lack of power. An absence of control.")
"Every week, that . . . rage seems to devour ever-more of him," she adds quietly. "I don't know how much of the man I married is still left inside."
