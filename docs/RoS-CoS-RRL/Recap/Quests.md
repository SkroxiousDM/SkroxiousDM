### card 1
~~*"This card tells of history. Knowledge of the ancient will help you better understand your enemy."*<br>
A smirking guardsman looking up at a haughty priest, the priest’s pointing fingers mere inches from the guardsman’s nose as the guardsman readies a wickedly curved dagger behind his back. “The Nine of Glyphs—the Traitor.”<br>
***"I see the ancient foe of an old and noble house. The wandering soul will guide you to him."***<br>~~
**You are pretty sure this was the spirit of Leo Dilisnya He dropped a Book that you have as yet been unable to open.**

### card 2
*"This card tells of a powerful force for good and protection, a holy symbol of great hope."*<br>
 an armored warrior clutching a cracked iron sword and a leather-bound wooden shield, his face obscured by a heavy iron helmet. “The Five of Swords—the Myrmidon.”<br>
***"Look for a den of wolves in the hills overlooking a mountain lake. The treasure belongs to Mother Night."***<br>

### card 3
*"This is a card of power and strength. It tells of a weapon of vengeance: a sword of sunlight."*<br>
a solemn-faced man clad in holy vestments, one hand clutching the chain of a bronze censer that billows with burning smoke. “The Eight of Glyphs—the Bishop.”<br>
***"What you seek lies in a pile of treasure, beyond a set of amber doors."***<br>

### card 4
~~*"This card sheds light on one who will help you greatly in the battle against darkness."*<br>
a quiet graveyard choked with fog, its entrance sealed with a sharp iron fence. "The Mists."<br>
***"A Vistana wanders this land alone, searching for her mentor. She does not stay in one place for long. Seek her out at Saint Markovia's abbey, near the mists."***<br>~~
**You have met Ezmirelda D'Avenir at St. Markovias Abbey**

### card 5
*"Your enemy is a creature of darkness, whose powers are beyond mortality. When the hour of judgment arrives, this card will lead you to him!"*<br>
a depiction of a crowned, grinning emperor clad in royal finery and reaching for a goblet of wine—though his limbs are wooden puppet’s limbs, lashed to corded strings that disappear into the darkness overhead. "The Marionette."<br>
***"Look to great heights. Find the beating heart of the castle. He waits nearby."***<br>

## Retrieve the Long-lost Spear of the Huntress from Dostron's Tomb in Castle Ravenloft
Kavan tells them where to find the spear that he stole from the Forest Fane of the Huntress, whose return may convince the people of Soldav to grant them entry. “The spear's power waned when I took it, and it has no doubt grown ever-weaker since," he says. "But, should it serve your purposes, you can find it in the tomb of King Dostron, who claimed it from my tent when my chiefdom crumbled in the wake of his armies." <br> Kavan can inform the players that the tomb of King Dostron was hewn from the stone beneath Dostron’s fortress, which Dostron built in the eastern mountains—upon what is now called the Pillarstone of Ravenloft. Should they find it, Kavan asks that they take it to the shrine of the Ladies Three in Soldav, to reconsecrate it in the sacred spring there and redeem his past mistakes.

##### Baba Lysaga's Scrying of Illya Krezkov:
***“I see a boy,” she hisses, “adolescent, shaggy-haired, and claw-scarred.” Her voice is a mixture of intrigue and mockery, and she licks her lips in obvious amusement. “They have collared him with silver, and chained him to a post. There he sits, huddled and pathetic. His eyes, oh, they are hidden, buried in his knees as he snivels and sobs.”,<br>She frowns, as if concentrating, and her voice drops to a rasping whisper. “The post is in a cavern—a dismal chamber lit by flickering torchlight. There is a woman chained beside him, sharp-eyed and with long, shaggy hair. I smell the gift of Mother Night on her. Nearby, I see a statue of a woman, wolf-headed—an idol to Mother Night, adorned in garlands and surrounded by a bounty of treasure. Rotting corpses kneel before her, bent to her majesty.” ***
### 4. Investigate the werewolf den the 13th night of Neyavr, while the bulk of the pack is away hunting.
Ezmerelda found what she believes to be Ilya’s location: a cavern at the base of a spur of Mount Baratok along the northwestern shore of Lake Baratok. Barovia’s werewolf pack uses the cave as its den, making any effort to rescue Ilya tremendously risky.
After capturing and interrogating a werewolf with the Barovian pack, Ezmerelda learned that the bulk of the pack will soon be departing Barovia to range beyond the Mists with Strahd's permission. The pack's expedition will take place at dusk the 13th night of Neyavr. "My source didn't know how long the pack would be away," she notes. "It might be anywhere from twelve hours until twelve days, so we'll want to get in and out before dawn."

##### ***The Vision***
 ~~-------------------------~~   
A rush of ethereal wind sweeps through the room—and a radiant burst of light erupts from the center of the pentagram, painting the walls in shades of silver and gold.<br>
Flashes of images flicker across your mind's eyes:<br>
+ A white-robed woman kneeling before a man with wings as white as the purest snow, who directs a gold-robed woman to present her with a silver statuette of a cleric kneeling in supplication, its chest glowing with the same golden light that encircles that man's head. [humility]<br>
+ The white-robed woman, standing before a half-built structure atop a cold mountain spur, her hands calloused as she lays bricks upon a mortared wall. [hope]<br>
+ The same woman, raising a golden mace above her head, a prayer upon her lips as a shadowed fortress looms above her. [defiance]
+ The silver statuette, sitting alone in a dark, cold tomb beneath a dark, twisted keep. The man, alone on a mountaintop, a veil of mist shrouding his eyes. [sorrow ]<br>
Each image is accompanied by a surge of emotion: humility, hope, defiance, and sorrow so strong it rakes at your chest with long, bitter claws. But as quickly as they appeared—the visions fade, and when you open your eyes again, you find the room returned to its former state. <br>
