### card 1
~~*"This card tells of history. Knowledge of the ancient will help you better understand your enemy."*<br>
A smirking guardsman looking up at a haughty priest, the priest’s pointing fingers mere inches from the guardsman’s nose as the guardsman readies a wickedly curved dagger behind his back. “The Nine of Glyphs—the Traitor.”<br>
***"I see the ancient foe of an old and noble house. The wandering soul will guide you to him."***<br>~~
**You are pretty sure this was the spirit of Leo Dilisnya He dropped a Book that you have as yet been unable to open.**

### card 2
*"This card tells of a powerful force for good and protection, a holy symbol of great hope."*<br>
 an armored warrior clutching a cracked iron sword and a leather-bound wooden shield, his face obscured by a heavy iron helmet. “The Five of Swords—the Myrmidon.”<br>
***"Look for a den of wolves in the hills overlooking a mountain lake. The treasure belongs to Mother Night."***<br>

### card 3
*"This is a card of power and strength. It tells of a weapon of vengeance: a sword of sunlight."*<br>
a solemn-faced man clad in holy vestments, one hand clutching the chain of a bronze censer that billows with burning smoke. “The Eight of Glyphs—the Bishop.”<br>
***"What you seek lies in a pile of treasure, beyond a set of amber doors."***<br>

### card 4
~~*"This card sheds light on one who will help you greatly in the battle against darkness."*<br>
a quiet graveyard choked with fog, its entrance sealed with a sharp iron fence. "The Mists."<br>
***"A Vistana wanders this land alone, searching for her mentor. She does not stay in one place for long. Seek her out at Saint Markovia's abbey, near the mists."***<br>~~
**You have met Ezmirelda D'Avenir at St. Markovias Abbey**

### card 5
*"Your enemy is a creature of darkness, whose powers are beyond mortality. When the hour of judgment arrives, this card will lead you to him!"*<br>
a depiction of a crowned, grinning emperor clad in royal finery and reaching for a goblet of wine—though his limbs are wooden puppet’s limbs, lashed to corded strings that disappear into the darkness overhead. "The Marionette."<br>
***"Look to great heights. Find the beating heart of the castle. He waits nearby."***<br>
