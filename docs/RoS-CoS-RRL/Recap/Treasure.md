This elegant platinum staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to weapon attack and damage rolls made with it.You gain these benefits while wielding the staff:
- If you aren’t wearing armor, your base Armor Class is 15 + your Dexterity modifier.

- Spear of the Huntress
This six-foot shaft of ash wood is adorned with carvings of wild animals, vines, and leaves, and bears a simple, yet sharp stone head. When first recovered from Dostron’s sarcophagus, it has the properties of a blood spear (Blood Spear, p. 221), but its wielder gains only a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it instead of +2. (The spear was corrupted long ago by the influence of Kavan and the Devourer, and can be restored only by reconsecrating the Forest Fane at Yester Hill, which the players can learn about at the Mountain Folk settlement of Soldav on Mount Ghakis.)
