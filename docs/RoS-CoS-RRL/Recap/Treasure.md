###  Spear of the Huntress
This six-foot shaft of ash wood is adorned with carvings of wild animals, vines, and leaves, and bears a simple, yet sharp stone head. When first recovered from Dostron’s sarcophagus, it has the properties of a blood spear (Blood Spear, p. 221), but its wielder gains only a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it instead of +2. (The spear was corrupted long ago by the influence of Kavan and the Devourer, and can be restored only by reconsecrating the Forest Fane at Yester Hill, which the players can learn about at the Mountain Folk settlement of Soldav on Mount Ghakis.)

### Icon of Dawn’s Grace
The Icon of Dawn’s Grace is largely as described in Icon of Ravenloft (p. 222), but does not grant the benefits of a protection from evil and good spell. Instead, it gains the following additional feature, which can be used only by a creature attuned to the icon:

Protection from Evil. You can present the icon as an action to grant yourself and each creature within 30 feet of you the effect of a protection from evil and good spell against fiends and undead until the start of your next turn. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dawn.

The Icon of Dawn’s Grace is a sentient magic item (see Dungeon Master’s Guide, p. 214) inhabited and empowered by a shard of the Abbot’s divine consciousness. The icon, which is Lawful Good, has hearing and darkvision out to 120 feet and the Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores of a deva. In addition, it can understand all languages and communicate telepathically with any character that carries or wields it.

The icon, which greets its carrier or wielder warmly, can share the following information if requested:

It is a shard of the divinity of the deva Ithuriel, an angelic servant of the Morninglord, placed within the icon to mark the Morninglord’s anointed prophet with His grace and provide her counsel.
More than four hundred years ago, Ithuriel bestowed it upon the cleric Saint Markovia, who was “wise beyond her years," and a zealous, yet compassionate follower of the Morninglord.
Markovia took the icon to the valley that would one day be called Barovia, and there founded an abbey upon a spur of Mount Baratok, which she held out as a refuge to victims of the conflicts beyond the valley.
After Strahd von Zarovich conquered the valley and became a vampire, Saint Markovia marched forth to Castle Ravenloft with her followers, but all were destroyed in the ensuing clash. Saint Markovia’s remains were laid to rest in this crypt, the icon left beside them.
If provided the Abbot’s description, the icon recognizes his appearance as one of the guises Ithuriel once used to walk among mortals on the Material Plane. If informed of the Abbot’s corruption and fall from grace, the icon urges the players to bring it to the Abbey and present it to the Abbot, so that the Abbot can reunite with its untainted divinity and cleanse the corruption that lies upon his spirit.
