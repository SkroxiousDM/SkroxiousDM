Alias: Izek

If you are forced to run an Izek scene, I have a loose template for that…
- establish tension through Izek calling them out on something “illegal”
- he has spies so he could have seen something
- in your case, maybe his grudge against the Martikovs holds up and he considers them conspirators
- he allows the scene to play out for a few minutes, taking every opportunity to bully them or outright steal something from them.
- when he is sick and tired of it, it gives them an ultimatum.
- the ultimatum forces them to do something horrible.
- basically they can extricate themselves from the situation or escalate the situation. 
- Izek knows this and is ready to throw down.
- for example he could demand they kill a raven right over there or he is gonna throw them in the stocks.
