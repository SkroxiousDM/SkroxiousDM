### Act I: Into the Mists…
### Act II: The Shadowed Town
*For characters of 4th level and higher.*

In this act, the players are left to explore the shadowed town of Vallaki—a Barovian settlement that has fallen to tension and conflict in the wake of Strahd's awakening.

As the players seek to complete lingering obligations—escorting Ireena to St. Andral's Church, purchasing and delivering a toy for the Vistani child Arabelle, and uncovering the *Tome of Strahd*—they meet new allies and enemies, including Father Lucian, the priest of St. Andral's Church; Izek Strazni, Baron Vallakovich's brutal enforcer; and Lady Fiona Wachter, the Baron's Strahd-loyalist rival.

At St. Andral's Church, the players will be tasked with recovering the stolen bones of St. Andral in order to protect the church's holy protection. At the nearby Vistani encampment, the players will have an opportunity to prove themselves heroes by finding and rescuing Arabelle following her mysterious disappearance—and receive a mysterious prophecy if they do. And at Wachterhaus, the ancestral home of House Wachter, the players will be given a choice: slay Izek Strazni and allow Lady Wachter to seize power—or do nothing, and allow the Baron's mad reign to continue.

Meanwhile, one of the players begins to experience haunting apparitions, leading them to discover the tragic fate of Stella Wachter's soul—and an opportunity to restore her broken mind. Simultaneously, a nocturnal killer haunts Vallaki's streets, secretly working to drive the disguised vampire hunter Dr. Rudolph van Richten out of hiding.

Through it all, the players will have an opportunity to seek out clues leading to the hidden location of the *Tome of Strahd*, which—depending on the Tarokka reading they received—may be hidden in the Baron's mansion or in Wachterhaus. And as the date of the Festival of the Blazing Sun approaches, Izek Strazni and Ireena Kolyana grow closer to a fateful, yet tragic encounter.

Act II ends when the players reach 5th level. However, the players can still complete unresolved arcs from this act even after Act III begins—assuming, of course, that those arcs are still possible to complete.

### Act III: The Broken Land
*For characters of 5th level and higher.*

In this act, the players receive a plea from Urwin Martikov to investigate the Wizard of Wines winery—and an invitation from Strahd to dine at Castle Ravenloft.

If the players agree to Urwin's request, they are joined by Muriel Vinshaw—the secret identity of the disguised **wereraven** that they rescued near Tser Pool. As the players work to free the winery from the scourge of druids and blights that have invaded it, Muriel relays an excerpt of Strahd's foretelling to Davian Martikov, an elder **wereraven** and the leader of the Keepers of the Feather.

Upon freeing the winery from the druids' clutches, Davian asks them to journey to Yester Hill to the south, where the druids are plotting a dark ritual that threatens the vineyard's destruction. Upon defeating the druids, the players will have an opportunity to speak with Strahd by the Whispering Wall and to learn of the hidden settlement of Yaedrag from Kavan, the spirit of an ancient Mountain Folk chieftain.

Once the players have recovered the winery's stolen gemstone and returned it to Davian Martikov, they can learn the true nature of the Keepers of the Feather and gain Muriel's knowledge of Strahd's cryptic fortunetelling.

Should the players accept Strahd's invitation to dine at Ravenloft, they will be escorted by Strahd's black carriage to the castle, where they will meet Strahd's servants, brides, and consorts. After dining with Strahd himself and learning of the castle's history, the players will have an opportunity to tour the castle, to dance with Strahd's brides, and—if they choose—to solve a brief mystery on Strahd's behalf.

Act III ends when the players complete or refuse both the Martikovs' quest and Strahd's dinner invitation. However, the players can still complete the Martikovs' quest until the end of Act IV, at which point the **tree blight** Wintersplinter destroys the winery if the druids' ritual hasn't already been stopped.



In this act, the players have an opportunity to delve more deeply into the hooks they've received into the western portion of the valley, including the **revenant's** invitation to Argynvostholt, the location of the *Holy Symbol of Ravenkind*, and the identity of Strahd's foretold enemy.

Upon gaining access to the village of Krezk, the players will have an opportunity to assist Baron Dmitri Krezkov in finding and rescuing his son, Ilya—a secret **werewolf** like his father—from the hidden werewolf den nearby. There, the players can meet Zuleika Toranescu, a **werewolf** priestess of Mother Night who asks them to rescue her mate, Emil, from the dungeons of Castle Ravenloft in exchange for the *Holy Symbol of Ravenkind*.

While within Krezk, the players can also meet the Abbot of the Abbey of Saint Markovia, a **deva**. Though the players can accept the Abbot's request to obtain a wedding dress from Vallaki in exchange for his resurrection magic, the spirit of Saint Markovia warns them that he has fallen from grace—and that they must obtain the holy symbol of the cleric Tasha Petrovna from the catacombs of Ravenloft in order to restore him.

Should the players visit Argynvostholt, the former headquarters of the Order of the Silver Dragon, they can learn the ancient history of the Order—and the nature of its current schism. From Sir Godfrey Gwilym, they can also learn that Kasimir Velikov, a dusk elf **mage**, shares an interest in the mysterious Amber Temple and has attempted to visit it in the recent past.

As the players explore the mansion, the spirit of Argynvost himself will set them a dangerous task: to recover his remains from the Hall of Bones in Castle Ravenloft. If the players assisted Lady Fiona Wachter in becoming Burgomaster in Act II, Vallaki's forthcoming "Blood Tax" can provide a night on which Strahd will be absent from the castle—and therefore present a perfect opportunity for a heist.

If the players infiltrate Castle Ravenloft, they can recover Argynvost's skull from the Hall of Bones, Emil Toranescu from the castle dungeons, and Tasha Petrovna's holy symbol from the catacombs beneath the castle. Along the way, they'll likely do battle with any or all of Strahd's brides.

By returning Argynvost's skull to Argynvostholt, the players can relight the beacon of the Order of the Silver Dragon, bringing hope to the valley and allowing the revenants' spirits to find peace. By rescuing Emil, they can gain a powerful ally in defeating the current leader of the werewolf pack, Kiril Stoyanovich, and win the *Holy Symbol of Ravenkind*. Finally, by obtaining Tasha Petrovna's holy symbol and defeating the Abbot in combat, the players can restore the grace of his divine spirit, providing Krezk with a mighty protector.

Act IV ends when the players recruit Kasimir to journey to the Amber Temple. However, the players can still complete unresolved arcs from this act even after Act V begins—assuming, of course, that those arcs are still possible to complete.

### Act V: Secrets of the Ancient
*For characters of 8th level and higher.*

In this act, the players journey with the dusk elf Kasimir Velikov to the Amber Temple, traveling along Tsolenka Pass as they ascend Mount Ghakis. As they do, they can befriend the Mountain Folk of Yaedrag, including Elder Ormir, an ancient **storm giant** and devotee of the Ladies Three. From Ormir, the players can learn of the three Fanes of Barovia, and of the profane knowledge that Strahd took from the Amber Temple to desecrate them.


After overcoming the trials of Mount Ghakis's slopes, including Strahd's chamberlain Rahadin, the **giant goat** Sangzor, multiple fiends corrupted by the Amber Temple, and the **roc** of Mount Ghakis itself, the players can finally arrive at their destination. Within the Amber Temple, the players can obtain the broken hilt of the *Sunsword*, as well as the arcane secrets that Strahd used to corrupt the Barovian Fanes—and which can, in turn, be used to restore them.

Upon restoring the memory of the **lich** Exethanter and sharing with him the schematics found in the *Tome of Strahd*, the players can also learn Strahd's ultimate plan: to channel the power of the Fanes into the indestructible Heart of Sorrow within Castle Ravenloft, which Strahd will use to tear open the Mists and escape. The players will also learn that Strahd plans to consume the souls of all Barovia in order to power his audacious scheme, and that he cannot ever truly be killed unless severed from the Fanes' power.

With the broken hilt of the *Sunsword* in their hands, the players are called by a mysterious voice to return to the Shrine of the White Sun in Krezk. There, they can meet the spirit of Sergei von Zarovich, who offers to use the power of the blessed pool to restore the *Sunsword's* radiant blade. 

If Ireena still accompanies the players, Sergei invites her to take sanctuary with him—an offer which she denies if the players have treated her with kindness and courage. If she rejects him, Sergei advises Ireena to journey to the ruined manor in Berez, where a wandering spirit can help her learn the true nature of Strahd's curse—and her own.

Soon after descending Mount Ghakis, the players also learn that the swamp-witch Baba Lysaga has sealed the Wizard of Wines and Blue Water Inn within dual *mirage arcane* spells and taken Muriel Vinshaw prisoner at her creeping hut—and that she plans to return with an army of wereraven-slaying **strix** to exterminate the Keepers of the Feather for good.

In Berez, the players can do battle with Baba Lysaga, freeing Muriel and the swarms of other ravens that Baba Lysaga has kept captive. Should the players bring Ireena to Marina's Monument nearby, they can also encounter the **ghost** of Burgomaster Lazlo Ulrich, the father of Marina Ulrich—one of Ireena's past lives. 

Ulrich can guide the party to Marina's Monument within the swamp, where Ireena can experience the deaths of her past lives and learn the terrible truth: that, in order to escape Strahd's predation, each of her past lives ultimately accepted the gift of the Dark Powers themselves—the oblivion of death. With the players' aid, Ireena can defy the Dark Powers' temptations and reclaim a power of defiance and hope.

Act V ends when the players first enter the Swamp Fane (in Berez), Mountain Fane (on Yester Hill), or Forest Fane (by Old Bonegrinder). However, the players can still complete unresolved arcs from this act until all three Fanes have been reconsecrated—at which point all quests will become impossible to complete.

### Act VI: The Curse of Strahd
*For characters of 9th level and higher.*

In this act, the players reconsecrate the Swamp Fane, the Mountain Fane, and the Forest Fane. Soon after the last Fane is restored, however, Strahd's masterstroke unfolds. By releasing the stored energy bound within the Heart of Sorrow, Strahd plunges Barovia into an eternal night—and turns the valley itself into desecrated ground. 

As an undead apocalypse threatens to overwhelm the Barovian people, the players must journey to Castle Ravenloft to face Strahd at the Heart of Sorrow. As the final battle unfolds, the Heart of Sorrow shows visions of Strahd's undead siege from across Barovia—and of the heroic resistance shown by the allies and friends that the players have made across their journey:

***Village of Barovia.*** If the players escorted Ireena to Vallaki, reconciled Doru with Father Donavich, befriended Dr. Rudolph van Richten in Vallaki, and inspired Ireena to reject Sergei's invitation, the village of Barovia is saved by the leadership and prowess of Ismark Kolyanovich, Doru and Donavich, Dr. Van Richten and the **ghost** Erasmus van Richten, and the spirit of Sergei von Zarovich.

***Town of Vallaki.*** If the players restored the soul of Stella Wachter, aided Lady Fiona Wachter in defeating Izek Strazni, located the missing Vistana Arabelle, recovered the stolen bones of St. Andral, and rescued the Blue Water Inn from Baba Lysaga, the town of Vallaki is saved by the power and foresight of Lady Fiona Wachter and her cult; the young **mage** Victor Vallakovich; the Vistani Luvash, Arrigal, and Arabelle; the dusk elves; the priest Father Lucian Petrovich; and the **wereravens** Urwin Martikov and Danika Dorakova.

***Village of Krezk.*** If the players rescued Ilya Krezkov from the Werewolf Den, rescued Emil Toranescu from the dungeons of Castle Ravenloft, and restored the Abbot's divine grace, the village of Krezk is saved by the might and savagery of the redeemed Abbot, the Belview **mongrelfolk**, the Krezkov **werewolves**, and Emil's new **werewolf** pack.

***Wizard of Wines.*** If the players saved the Wizard of Wines from the druids and Wintersplinter, defeated Baba Lysaga, and relit the beacon of Argynvostholt, the winery is saved by the combined efforts of the Keepers of the Feather and the spirits of the Order of the Silver Dragon.

***Settlement of Yaedrag.*** If the players aided the Mountain Folk within the Amber Temple and reconsecrated the Fanes of Barovia, the settlement of Yaedrag is saved by the sudden arrival of the Mountain Folk warrior Helwa, the chieftain Kavan and his warband of spirits, the bestial spirits of the Huntress, and the **roc** of Mount Ghakis itself.

Should the players defeat Strahd, the Mists vanish and the sun rises over Barovia once again—a free land, at long last.

## Arc L: Strahd’s Enemy
> In this arc, upon gaining entry to Krezk, the players must ascend to the Abbey of Saint Markovia, where they are destined to meet their foretold ally against Strahd.
> 
> Upon their arrival, the Abbot can provide the players with a brief tour and history of the Abbey, as well as inform them that the Vistana monster-hunter Ezmerelda d’Avenir has been a guest of the Abbey in recent days. 
> 
> If the players have arrived before the third night after the full moon, the Abbot informs the players that Ezmerelda is away and will return soon. If the players have arrived on or after the third night after the full moon, the Abbot leads them to Ezmerelda, who is glad to join their efforts—on the condition that they help her save Krezk from the Abbot’s madness.
> 
## Arc M: St. Markovia’s Plea
> In this arc, as a condition of recruiting Ezmerelda to their cause and to save Baroness Anna Krezkova from a terrible fate, the players conduct a seance at the Abbey of Saint Markovia—and are contacted by the spirit of Saint Markovia herself. 
> 
> Saint Markovia’s ghost solemnly informs them that the Abbot, a **deva** of the Morninglord, has lost himself to corruption and madness. To restore his sanity and protect the village, the players must journey to Castle Ravenloft, retrieve the *Icon of Ravenloft* from the tomb of Prefect Ciril Romulich, and return to the Abbey of Saint Markovia, where they must do battle with the Abbot. Should the players emerge victorious, they can cleanse the Abbot’s divine spark with the aid of the *Icon*, restoring him to his rightful mind.
<div style="height: 10px;"></div>
## Arc N: The Den of Wolves
> In this arc, the players must locate the den of the Barovian werewolf pack, which holds the *Holy Symbol of Ravenkind* as foretold by Madam Eva. If the players previously uncovered the location of Baron Dmitri Krezkov’s son, Ilya, in ***Arc J: The Walls of Krezk***, Baron Krezkov also asks them to rescue him from the werewolves’ clutches, promising sanctuary and aid if they do.
> 
> With the aid of Ezmerelda d’Avenir, the players can track the werewolf den to a quiet crag on the northwestern shore of Lake Baratok. During a nighttime stakeout on the edge of the Svalich Wood, the players must wait until the pack emerges to hunt, then slip into the den and bypass  any lingering guards before pushing through to the shrine of Mother Night.
> 
> There, the players meet Zuleika Krezkova—a **werewolf** cleric of Mother Night and the elder sister of Baron Dmitri Krezkov. Zuleika is the mate of Emil Toranescu: the former **werewolf** pack leader that Kiril Stoyanovich deposed when Strahd awoke from his slumber. Zuleika agrees to lift Mother Night’s protection from the shrine and allow the players to retrieve the *Holy Symbol of Ravenkind* and win Ilya’s freedom if they first rescue Emil from the dungeons of Castle Ravenloft.
> 
> Should the players succeed in retrieving Emil from the dungeons, he asks the players to aid him in battle against Kiril to regain his place as leader of the pack. If the players win, Emil promises to end the pack’s hunts against the people of Barovia, and allows them to take Ilya peacefully back to Krezk.
> 
## Arc O: The Beacon of Argynvostholt
> In this arc, upon arriving at the mansion of Argynvostholt as suggested by the revenants at Tser Falls or the Raven River Crossroads, the players encounter Sir Godfrey Gwilym, an ancient **revenant** knight of the Order of the Silver Dragon.
> 
> Godfrey solemnly informs the players that, because he is bound to the will of his commander, Vladimir Horngaard, he can offer them no aid in their fight against Strahd. He can share, however, that the spirit of the silver dragon Argynvost—the deceased leader of their Order—may yet have wisdom or guidance to grant them. 
> 
> Though Godfrey cannot hear the voice of Argynvost himself, he encourages the players to explore the mansion and seek out the clues left by the dragon’s spirit—though he warns them to avoid the audience hall of Commander Horngaard himself. Godfrey also warns the players to be wary of the cursed spirits that still haunt the mansion’s halls: soldiers who fell defending the mansion from Strahd’s armies long ago, and who have never ceased their fight against invaders.
> 
> As the players explore Argynvostholt, they can learn from Argynvost’s weakened spirit that his knights have fallen from grace, but that they might yet be restored—and hope returned to the valley—if the players retrieve the dragon’s bones from Castle Ravenloft and return them to their rightful place in his crypt.
> 
> As the players move to depart Argynvostholt, they are confronted by Vladimir Horngaard himself, who declines to let them leave unless the players convince him that they’re no threat to Strahd. Whether the players escape by word or by force, Vladimir dispatches a **phantom warrior** to watch them from the Ethereal Plane as they travel, ensuring a suitable punishment when they return.
> 
> If the players return to Argynvostholt after successfully retrieving Argynvost’s skull, they must fight their way past Vladimir and his **phantom warrior** bodyguards in order to return the dragon’s remains to their rightful place. Should they succeed, Argynvost’s spirit lights the beacon atop the darkened mansion, bringing light and hope to all corners of Barovia, and allowing the knights of the Order of the Silver Dragon to find rest and blessed peace.
> 
## Arc P: The Moonlit Murders
> In this arc, which begins three days after the night of the full moon, a series of grisly murders in Vallaki push Lady Fiona Wachter to ask the players to hunt down the primary suspect: the legendary vampire hunter Dr. Rudolph van Richten.
> 
> After speaking with Dr. Van Richten, investigating the crime scene, and interviewing one of the witnesses—the eccentric toymaker Gadof Blinsky—the players can track the culprit to the home of the true murderer: Ernst Larnak, Lady Wachter’s own **spy** and a secret agent of Anastrasya Karelova, one of Strahd’s vampiric brides. 
> 
> Should the players defeat Anastrasya, she flees for the safety of Castle Ravenloft,  the string of murders comes to an end, and Lady Wachter rewards the players for their courage and ingenuity.
