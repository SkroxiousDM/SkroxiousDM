## Arc A. Escape From Death House

  

The players begin in the town of Daggerford on the night before Highharvesttide, an annual feast and holiday celebration. The local inns are full for the night, and the players—vagabonds with little coin or company to speak of—find shelter in the stable of the Nightmare’s Bridle, a ramshackle tavern on the outskirts of town. 

  

When the relics they carry sense the presence of Death House, however, the players are led through Daggerfords’ rainy streets and into the house’s waiting threshold.

  

Once inside, the players are trapped and told that a monster will hunt them down once it awakens. They have six hours to find it first and either appease it with a suitable sacrifice—or kill it. As they explore the house, they come to learn the house’s lurid history, as well as the true identity of the beast that lurks beneath.

  

If the players kill the monster, the house begins to collapse, forcing them to flee or be lost in the rubble. Upon emerging, they find that their surroundings have changed, transporting them to the darkened land of Barovia.

#### A1a. The Nightmare’s Bridle

  

If one or more of your players are using the ***Barovian Relics*** hook, read the following text. Otherwise, proceed to ***A2. Death House*** below.

  

<div class="descriptive">

  

It’s the evening before Highharvesttide, and a storm has descended over Daggerford, with dark clouds pouring cascades of rain down upon the town below. Despite the weather, however, the town buzzes with anticipation of the impending falltime festival, each home filled with warmth and joy. Bright, cheery candlelight twinkles from every window, and the sounds of song and dance echo throughout the wet and muddy streets. 

  

Amidst the merriment, however, you stand apart. Neither locals nor visitors, you’re vagabonds—travelers, ghosts passing through an unfamiliar town. As laughter rings out from inns and homes, you face a simpler, starker dilemma: the quest for shelter.

  

Every room in this town is claimed, every hearth filled to bursting, leaving you in the grip of the bitter storm. Until, that is, the owner of the ramshackle Nightmare’s Bridle tavern offers you a grudging reprieve: the hayloft above their stable. It’s nothing to boast about, leaving the biting cold and the lingering scent of musty hay as your only companions. But it’s a roof over your heads nonetheless—a small mercy on a night such as this.

  

One by one, you find a home amidst the muck and hay. Overhead, rain lashes the stable, thunder punctuating the rhythmic drumming on the roof. Flashes of lightning lance across the skies, casting the stable’s interior in stark lights and darks. Rainwater drips steadily down through a leak in the roof, snaking its way across the floor until it pools in the corner.

  

Here, then, you find yourselves: huddled in the darkness amongst strangers, while joy and mirth dance just out of reach.

  

</div>

  

\pagebreakNum

  

Invite the players to describe each character's appearance and countenance, how they’ve positioned themselves, and how they’ve arranged their belongings.

  

When the players have finished introducing themselves, read:

  

<div class="descriptive">

  

A searing bolt of lightning rends the sky, illuminating the evening in a blinding flash of stark white. The booming thunder that follows is so loud it shakes the very ground beneath you, causing the timbers of the stable to creak and groan.

  

The light of the strike lingers unnaturally, silhouetting small wisps of fog that twist through the air. A thick, ankle-deep mist gathers outside, shrouding the earth in a ghostly veil. Its tendrils curl invitingly, as though beckoning you to the darkness beyond.

  

The rain continues to pelt the roof above, but the wind no longer howls, and the merry sounds of Daggerford’s festivities seem muted and distant. The horses in the stable beneath stir uneasily, their whinnies echoing loudly in the stillness. An uneasy feeling sweeps through the hayloft, a cold shiver that has nothing to do with the wind or rain.

  

</div>

  

One by one, the players’ relics then react as follows, in the following order.

  

* ***Stone Crest.*** The crest emits a low hum and smells of pine needles and earthy soil, which both grow stronger when the crest is moved toward Death House.

* ***Broken Blade.*** The blade emits a high-pitched hum and begins to tremble violently, spinning like a compass needle in the direction of Death House.

* ***Dragon's Scale.*** The scale burns icy cold, one end glowing with a bright, silver light in the direction of Death House.

* ***Sunrise Medallion.*** The medallion shines with a warm, golden glow, emitting rays of bright light in the direction of Death House.

* ***Amber Shard.*** The shard glows with amber light and tugs its cord in the direction of Death House.

* ***Wolf's Tooth.*** The tooth lengthens, glowing with silver moonlight, and tugs its cord in the direction of Death House.

* ***Crumpled Page.*** The ink on the page glows with amber light, the runes reshaping themselves into a map that shows the page's location—and an arrow that guides toward Death House.

* ***Tattered Banner.*** The sound of war-drums fills the air, and the banner blows in an unseen wind in the direction of Death House.

* ***Electrum Coin.*** The coin lands on its edge and begins rolling across the muddy cobblestones in the direction of Death House.

* ***Angel's Feather.*** The feather is swept away by an unseen wind, its barbs glimmering with golden light as it twirls through the streets toward Death House.

* ***Raven's Feather.*** The feather is swept away by the wind, its shadow seeming to dance in the air, as it twirls through the streets toward Death House.

* ***Wanderer's Scarf.*** The scarf is carried away by the wind, its patterns shifting and turning in the air as it whirls through the streets toward Death House.

  
  

If the players give chase, read:

  

<div class="descriptive" style="padding-bottom: 0px !important;">

  

You emerge from the hayloft into the swirling mists beyond, the stones of Daggerford's streets slick and gleaming beneath your feet. The city’s laughter and cheer is now but a hollow echo, the brightness of its revelry drowned in the fog that encircles you. The taste of the cold, damp air is sharp on your tongue, and the sound of your own breath loud in your ears. 

  

Your relics call you forward, the mists parting to make way. You move slowly at first, then faster, your hearts pounding in your chest. As you venture deeper into the fog, each step you make feels heavier, each echo of thunder a beat in this relentless march.

  

The fog swallows the town, buildings reduced to looming shadows, their shapes dancing and flickering in the storm's sporadic flashes of lightning. Rain drums a relentless rhythm, the patter of drops on cobblestone accompanying the distant, mournful peal of thunder. For brief moments, you can feel something else beneath your feet: the steady pounding of a deep and distant heartbeat.

  

You're pulled left, then right, then left again, the relics guiding you through the murky labyrinth. Distance and direction have lost all meaning, the shadows around you contorting in twisted shapes. Your blood sings in your ears, and the air grows denser, electric, as the energy of the storm—of the chase—swells with reckless abandon.

  

And then—the pounding stops.

  

The thunder pauses.

  

And the mist breaks.

  

The fog pulls back like a curtain, revealing a tall, eerie silhouette that towers in the gloom before you.

  

</div>

  

This is **Death House.**

  

### A2. Death House

  

If one or more of your players are using the ***Lost in the Mists*** hook, read the following text. Otherwise, proceed to ***A2a. The Arrival*** below.

  
  

<div class="descriptive">

  

Highharvesttide in Daggerford. It’s a time of joy and celebration, of hearth and home, of golden laughter ringing out into the night. But tonight, as a storm has swept over the town, you find yourselves apart from the warmth and revelry, drawn into the cold, dark embrace of mystery.

  

As mercenaries, you're no strangers to danger or the unknown. But this—this is different. Over the past few weeks, whispers have spread throughout Daggerford of disappearances: ordinary folk, vanished without a trace.

  

</div>

  

\pagebreakNum

  

<div class="descriptive">

  

The only connection? A grand, old manor, known in hushed tones as “Death House.”

  

Tonight, as the storm rages outside, you've been summoned to investigate this mysterious dwelling. The town crier’s proclamation still echoes in your ears, a bounty for any brave souls who dare to uncover the truth. Driven by a mix of greed, curiosity, and perhaps a touch of bravado, you stepped forward.

  

Now, guided by the faint glow of your lanterns, you traverse the slick, fog-shrouded cobblestone streets. The distant merriment is a stark contrast to the eerie quiet around you. The world has been reduced to hushed whispers and the steady drumming of rain, a somber serenade to your perilous journey.

  

And then, as if answering an unspoken summons, the mists before you part, revealing the grim silhouette of your destination: the “Death House.” Its dark, stone façade and towering spires loom ominously against the storm-tossed sky, a wordless challenge against your resolve.

  

</div>

  

#### A2a. The Arrival

  

##### 1. Entrance

  

Read all players the following text:

  

<div class=descriptive>

  

A grand manor stands before you, four stories of cold, soot-stained stone, tall narrow windows, and high peaked roofs forming a picture of austere, chilling grandeur. Midway up, a narrow balcony juts out from the third floor, offering a grim perch from which to survey the surrounding grounds.

  

The centerpiece of this imposing facade is the portico, a stone arch standing sentinel before the house's oaken doors. A wrought-iron gate fills this arch, its rusty hinges creaking as it sways in the wind. 

  

On either side of the gate, oil lamps hang from chains, their light dim and flickering, casting a sickly glow that barely pierces the surrounding fog.

  

Beyond the gate, a set of sturdy oaken doors stand closed, framed by the gate and the lamps. The doors are old and weathered, their wood darkened by time, but they stand strong and and proud—an unwelcome entrance to the house beyond.

  

A gust of wind sweeps past you, carrying with it a whisper of cold dread that sends shivers down your spine.

  

</div>

  

Any players who began with the ***Barovian Relics*** hook can now see the players who began with the ***Lost in the Mists*** hook, and vice-versa. (If any of the players’ relics flew or rolled to Death House—as with the ***wanderer’s scarf*** or the ***electrum coin***—they land on the house’s threshold, just beyond the portico.) The street is otherwise deserted.

  

The entrance beyond the portico is otherwise as described in **1. Entrance** (p. 212).

  

<div style="height: 1px"></div>

  

> ##### Strahd & the Cult

>

> The cult of Death House earned no love from Strahd in life. But in death, the two parties have come to an informal, unspoken understanding. In exchange for the permission to roam far afield from the misty land of Barovia to claim sacrifices, Death House is bound to return to the valley after each hunting excursion. Should any adventurers successfully escape the house's bloodied altar, they inevitably emerge into Strahd's domain—assuring him of a worthy crop of prey to pursue.

  

<div style="height: 1px"></div>

  

##### 2. Main Hall

  

When the players pass through Death House’s threshold, any Barovian relics they carry cease to be active. (For example, the *sunrise medallion* ceases to glow.)

  

The main hall is largely as described in **Main Hall** (p. 212) but now contains a grandfather clock, which is placed in the circular space at the base of the stairs.

  

Instead of a longsword, the portrait of the Durst family from **6. Upper Hall** (p. 213) now hangs above the fireplace. In the portrait, Rose is holding a smiling doll wearing a yellow lace dress. A plaque beneath the portrait reads: *Mr. Gustav and Mrs. Elisabeth Durst, with their two children, Rosavalda and Thornboldt.*<sup><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/8sfpkn/fleshing_out_curse_of_strahd_part_2_entering/">1</a></sup>

  

Shortly after all of the characters enter the main hall, the front door slams shut, extinguishing all lights in the house. The sound of the rain outside completely vanishes, leaving the house eerily silent. 

  

Bloody letters then begin appearing on the southern wall, just above the marble staircase. They read as follows:

  

<div class="descriptive" style="text-align: center;">

  
  

*Beneath this dwelling lurks a beast*

<br>

*Who hungers for a bloody feast.*

<br>

*He sleeps until the midnight chime*

<br>

*Then wakes to feed his dark design.*

<br>

*If morsels seek to flee their doom,*

<br>

*Then bring toward his secret room*

<br>

*A gift to soothe his savage mood*

<br>

*But mind the servants of his brood.*

  

</div>

  

The grandfather clock then strikes six o’clock.

  

A player who opens any outside-facing door or curtain in Death House, or who exits onto any balcony, finds that the exterior of the house has been surrounded by thick, fleshy tendrils. Although the tendrils can be damaged, more grow back swiftly to replace them, sealing the players inside. A player who inspects the tendrils finds that they appear to be extruding from beneath the house.

#### A2b. The First Floor

  

##### 1. Cloakroom

  

A player who investigates the cloakroom adjoining the Main Hall can observe an envelope poking from the pocket of one of the cloaks. The envelope, which is addressed to Lady Lovina Wachter, contains an invitation. It reads:

  

\pagebreakNum

  

<blockquote style="text-align:center;">

  

You are cordially invited to join

<div style="height: 3px;"></div>

  

*Dinner and refreshments to be served.*

  

</blockquote>

  

##### 2. Den of Wolves

  

This room is largely as described in **Den of Wolves** (p. 212). As the players enter this room, read:

  

<div class="descriptive">

  

As you crack the door to this room open, you catch a glimpse of something feral beyond: an amber eye that flashes in the darkness, and a bestial muzzle curled into a snarl.

</div>

  
  
  

If the players proceed, read:

  

<div class="descriptive">

  

The door cracks open, revealing a gray-furred wolf frozen into place. It's only a moment before you realize that it's not moving—and another before you realize that it's not alone. 

  

This oak-paneled room looks like a hunter's den. Mounted above the fireplace is a stag's head, and positioned around the outskirts of the room are two additional stuffed wolves—a large gray wolf and a smaller brown wolf.

  

Two padded chairs draped in animal furs face a hearth, with an oak table between them supporting an assortment of objects. A chandelier hangs above a cloth-covered table surrounded by four chairs, and two cabinets stand against the walls. A pair of small toys seems to have been forgotten beneath one of the chairs.

</div>

  

The discarded toys are small, plush gray wolves, whose threadbare coats show evidence of heavy mending and patchwork. Clumsy stitchwork on their stomachs reads ROSE and THORN, respectively.

  

In addition to its other contents, the east cabinet contains three silvered crossbow bolts mixed in with the other twenty bolts. Meanwhile, the north cabinet also contains a mounted piece of child's needlework that depicts a boy and girl holding the hands of a young woman, alongside clumsily stitched words that read FOR MISS KLARA. The young woman's face has been slashed and cut out.

  

The first time that no players are looking at them, the three taxidermied wolves move. When the players next look at them, the large gray wolf is standing beside the smaller brown wolf, and the first gray wolf has turned its snarl toward the others.

  

A player that succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (Nature) check can identify the large gray wolf as male and the other two as female.

  
  
  

<blockquote>

  

<h5>Time in Death House</h5>

  

When the clock strikes six, place three six-sided dice on the table in front of the players, with each side showing a six. Each pip on the dice represents twenty minutes until midnight. 

  

As the players explore the house, tick this dice clock downward to indicate the passage of time, always starting with the die showing the lowest number. If the lowest die shows a one, you can tick it down to “zero” by removing it from the group instead.

  

The dice clock counts down as follows:

  

* Each time the players enter a new floor of the house or dungeon, tick the dice clock down by one.

* Each time the players make a Perception or Investigation check to search an entire room, tick the dice clock down by one.

* Each time the players complete a short rest, tick the dice clock down by three.

  

The grandfather clock in the **Main Hall** sounds on the hour, every hour, and can be heard throughout the house and dungeon. 

  

When the clock strikes midnight, the **flesh mound** in the **Ritual Chamber** awakens and makes a beeline for the players, exiting through the **Hidden Trapdoor** into the **Den of Wolves** if necessary to reach them. At least one minute should pass between the time the mound wakes up and the time that it first reaches the players, nullifying its ***heavy sleeper*** feature and allowing it to use its ***multiattack*** actions.

  

<div style="height: 2px;"></div>

  

<h5>Resting in Death House</h5>

  

Due to their midnight deadline, it is impossible for the players to take a long rest in Death House. However, the players might still need to take a short rest. Each time they do so in the main house, they experience one or more of the following hauntings:

  

* A player hears rats scrabbling up and down the spaces between the walls. A thick, choking stench of rot seeps into the room.

* A player hears the sound of a woman’s humming emanating from the opposite side of a closed door. If the door is cracked open, a cold blue eye stares back before vanishing.

* A player hears footsteps descending from the attic, which stop outside of their door before moving away to the library. Soon after, a grinding noise can be heard coming from the library—the sound of the secret door.

* A player hears maniacal laughter echoing from far below the house.

* A player hears a pleading female voice in their right ear that swears that “it isn’t his.” Another, colder female voice in the player’s left ear scoffs and says, "You would say that, you little *harlot*."

</blockquote>

  

\pagebreakNum

  

##### 3. Dining Room

  

Players that approach this door can hear the muffled sound of a lively dinner feast, including clinking glasses, quiet laughter, and distant conversation. If the players open or knock on the door, however, the room falls silent, leaving only the stillness and the cold grandeur of the room beyond.

  

This room is largely as described in **Dining Room** (p. 213). When the players enter it, read:

  

<div class="descriptive">

  

You enter into a wood-paneled dining room. The centerpiece is a carved mahogany table surrounded by eight high-backed chairs with sculpted armrests and cushioned seats. A crystal chandelier hangs above the table, which is set with resplendent silverware and crystal glasses polished to a dazzling shine. Mounted above the marble fireplace is a mahogany-framed painting of an alpine vale.

  

The wall paneling is carved with elegant images of deer among the trees. Red silk drapes cover the windows, and a tapestry hangs from an iron rod bolted to the south wall.

  

The table groans beneath the weight of a delicious-looking feast. Exquisite dishes lay on grand platters: succulent roasted poultry glazed with a shimmering honey sauce, perfectly grilled cuts of beef still steaming lightly, a variety of cheeses and fresh fruits, and freshly baked breads giving off a comforting aroma. 

  

</div>

  

A player who partakes in the food suffers no ill effects.

  

##### 4. Kitchen and Pantry

  

This room is largely as described in **Kitchen and Pantry** (p. 213). When the players enter this room, read:

  

<div class="descriptive">

  

You enter a tidy kitchen, with dishware, cookware, and utensils neatly placed on shelves. A worktable has a cutting board and rolling pin atop it. A stone, dome-shaped oven stands near the east wall, its bent iron stovepipe connecting to a hole in the ceiling. Behind the stove and to the left is a thin door.

  

In the front right-hand corner of the room stands a small wooden door set into the wall.

  

</div>

  

If the players inspect the cookware, they find that the largest kitchen knife is missing.

  

A player who enters the pantry finds that one of the shelves contains a set of beautiful decorative plates painted with pictures of windmills. One of the plates appears to have been knocked off of the shelf and lies in shattered pieces on the floor, leaving an empty spot in the row of plates.

  

A few inches behind the empty spot on the shelf sits an antique copper pot, its lid slightly ajar. Peeking out from beneath the lid is the cork of what appears to be a bottle of wine.

  

A player who opens the pot finds it to contain a bottle of wine, a folded piece of delicate lace, a vial of a brownish dried powder, and a bouquet of wilted sunflowers tied to a small scroll of parchment.

  

* The wine's label shows that it is from the Wizard of Wines winery and provides the name of the wine: Champagne du le Stomp. (A player that drinks the wine finds it to have turned to vinegar, as though it has magically aged centuries in mere moments.)

* The piece of lace bears the initial "K" sewn onto one corner. 

* A successful DC 14 Intelligence (Nature) check identifies the brown powder as dried silphium, a contraceptive herb. 

* The parchment scroll reads: "For the light of my life. —G."

  

If the players read the note, one of the knives in the kitchen flies off of its shelf and embeds itself in the opposite wall.

  
  

#### A2c. The Second Floor

  
  

##### 1. Upper Hall

  

This room is largely as described in **Upper Hall** (p. 213). When the players enter this room, read:

  

<div class="descriptive">

  

Unlit oil lamps are mounted on the walls of this elegant hall. Hanging above the mantelpiece is a longsword with a windmill cameo worked into the hilt.

  

Standing suits of armor flank wooden doors in the east and west walls. Each suit of armor clutches a spear and has a visored helm shaped like a wolf's head. The doors between them are carved with images of dancing youths.

  

The red marble staircase continues its upward spiral to a third floor, a cold draft whispering down from above.

  

</div>

  

##### 2. Servants’ Room

  

This room is largely as described in **Servants’ Room** (p. 213). When the players enter this room, read:

  

<div class="descriptive">

  

This undecorated bedroom contains a pair of beds with straw-stuffed mattresses. At the foot of each bed is a closed foot locker. A door to the left appears to lead to a closet.

  

In the right-hand corner stands a small wooden door, a metal button set into the wall beside it. A basket full of unwashed laundry appears to have been left beside it.

  

</div>

  

The basket contains a man's laundry, including fine suits, tunics, neckties, pants, and stockings. However, a single, much-smaller woman's slip appears to have been mixed in with the rest.

  

##### 3. Conservatory

  

Players that approach this door can hear the faint sound of a harpsichord playing from beyond the doors. If the players open or knock on the door, however, the music falls silent.

  

This room is largely as described in **Conservatory** (p. 214). When the players enter it, read:

  

<div class="descriptive">

  

You enter into an elegantly appointed hall, the windows of which are covered by gossamer drapes. A brass-plated chandelier hangs from the ceiling, and upholstered chairs line the walls. 

  
  

</div>

  

\pagebreakNum

  

<div class="descriptive">

  
  

Several stained-glass wall hangings depict beautiful men, women, and children singing and playing instruments. A harpsichord with a bench rests in the northwest corner. Near the fireplace is a large standing harp. Alabaster figurines of well-dressed dancers adorn the mantelpiece. 

  

</div>

  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***The Harpsichord.*** A player who inspects the harpsichord finds that one of the keys appears to be permanently pressed in the "down" position. A player who investigates the interior of the harpsichord finds the cause: a rolled-up piece parchment tucked beneath one of the strings. 

  

The parchment is a piece of handwritten sheet music for the harpsichord titled *Waltz for Klara*. If the sheet music is played on the harpsichord, read:

  

<div class="descriptive">

  

As you press your fingers to the keys, the notes echo, a haunting melody filling the quiet, dusty room. As you continue to play, the music seems to take on a life of its own, your hands moving across the keys unbidden as if guided by an unseen force.

  

From the edges of the room, spectral figures begin to materialize, spinning and weaving in a ghostly dance as though led by the song. Most are unfamiliar to you, but you recognize two: Elisabeth Durst, in the corner, watching Gustav's apparition dancing with a beautiful young woman wearing humble clothes.

  

The eyes of Elisabeth's apparition eyes narrow into a cold, furious stare. The dancers pay her little heed, however, the song growing faster as the spirits whirl to the rhythm of the harpsichord's crescendo.

  

With a swift movement, Elisabeth reaches for a pendant around her spectral neck—a shimmering amber shard hung on a cord of ethereal mist. As her ghostly fist curls around it, her eyes flash a bright, menacing amber—and the spectral dancers dissipate, swept away as if by an unseen wind.

  

Elisabeth's apparition lingers but a moment longer before disappearing with the rest. As it does, a sound resonates through the room: the low sound of scraping wood, originating from the room across the hall. The floor trembles faintly—and you hear a crash from the mantelpiece. Two of the alabaster figurines have fallen from their place on the shelf: one, toppled over on its side; the other, shattered across the floor.

  

</div>

  

A player who inspects the fallen figurines finds that the toppled figurine has cracked across its face, arms, and torso, and depicts a young and slender female dancer. The shattered figurine has broken into dozens of pieces, and appears to have once depicted a comely, older man. A third, female dancer figurine remains defiantly standing atop the mantelpiece where all three once stood.

  

\columnbreak

  

##### 4. Library

  

This room is largely as described in **Library** (p. 213-14). When the players enter this room, read:

  

<div class="descriptive">

  

Red velvet drapes cover the windows of this room. An exquisite mahogany desk and a matching high-back chair face the entrance and the fireplace, above which hangs a framed picture of a windmill perched atop a rocky crag. Situated in corners of the room are two overstuffed chairs. 

  

Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves line the south wall. A rolling wooden ladder allows one to more easily reach the high shelves.

  

</div>

  

***The Desk.*** A handwritten note sits atop the desk. It reads:

  

<div style="height:2px;"></div>

  

<blockquote>

  

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Durst,

  

In light of my current condition, I respectfully ask your leave for a brief time away from my responsibilities. 

  

While my devotion to your dear children makes this decision difficult, I have taken it upon myself to find a solution that, I hope, will serve your household well. A good acquaintance of mine is experienced in the care of children, and I believe that she could assume my role during my temporary leave without difficulty.

  

I realize that my request is not without its complications. However, my years serving your family have shown me the depth of your understanding and compassion. I truly feel that I have become a part of this family, and I look forward to bringing another member of that family into this world.

  

Yours sincerely,

  

Klara

  

</blockquote>

  
  

<div style="height:2px;"></div>

  

The top drawer of the desk now contains a number of receipts for candles, daggers, and incense, rather than the key to *20. Children's Room** (p. 215).

  

***The Bookshelves.*** A small rock collection sits upon one of the shelves, each of the stones labeled with its scientific name.<sup><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/49bvms/notes_from_running_death_house/">4</a></sup> (This collection once belonged to Mr. Durst.) 

  

Immediately beside the rock collection is a book titled _The Tale of &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;_, with the final word being the name of the player character who first found it. It appears blank to any other creature, but, if read by that player character, tells the story of their life.<sup><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/7pjhpa/dm_tips_curse_of_strahd_part_1_intro_death_house/">2</a></sup>

  

The final written page of this book reads:

  

<blockquote style="text-align: left; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 20px;">

  

<em>&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; pulled the book down from the shelf and began to read, unaware of the creature that watched them from the shadows. Slowly, the beast began to creep forward.</em> 

  

</blockquote>

  

\pagebreakNum

  

The next page is blank, save for a bloodstain. A search of the room provides no evidence of any lurking monster.

  

A character that searches the room and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check can see flickering candle light emanating from beneath the secret door.<sup><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/49bvms/notes_from_running_death_house/">4</a></sup>

  

***The Secret Door.*** The secret door in this room has two components. First, a player must pull on the switch as described in **Secret Door** (p. 214). Doing so causes the bookshelf to swing forward, revealing a blank wooden wall behind it. 

  

Once the bookshelf has been moved, the players can see a small panel made of dark wood behind it, built into the wall at approximately chest level. A small hollow niche, jagged and irregular, lies at the panel's center and emanates a faint amber glow. 

  

The door cannot be opened unless the amber shard from the **Master Suite** (see below) is placed into the niche. The secret door then swings open, allowing the players to enter the **Secret Room**.

##### 5. Secret Room

  

This room is largely as described in **Secret Room** (p. 214). When the players enter this room, read:

  

<div class="descriptive">

  

This small hidden room is packed with bookshelves groaning with old and ominous-looking leather-bound tomes. A heavy wooden chest with clawed iron feet stands against the south wall, its lid half-closed. Sticking out of the chest, its ribs and head caught beneath the lid, is a skeleton in leather armor.

  

</div>

  

Change Strahd’s letter to read as follows:

  

<blockquote style="text-align: left; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 20px;">

  

My most pathetic servant,

  

I am not a messiah sent to you by the Dark Powers of this land. I have not come to lead you on a path to immortality. However many souls you have bled on your hidden altar, however many visitors you have tortured in your dungeon, know that you are not the one who brought me to this beautiful land. You are but a worm writhing in my earth.

  

You say that you are cursed, your fortune spent. Your husband took solace in the bosom of another woman, sired a bastard son, and drove you to abandon love for madness. Cursed by darkness? Of that I have no doubt. Save you from your wretchedness? I think not. I much prefer you as you are.

  

Your dread lord and master,

  

Strahd von Zarovich

  

</blockquote>

  

The players do not recognize the name "Strahd von Zarovich."

  

#### A2d. The Third Floor

  

As the players ascend the spiral stairs to the third floor, remind them that they can see down the center of the staircase all the way to the bottom floor.

  

<blockquote>

  

<h5> Making Multiple Ability Checks </h5>

  

As the players explore Death House and the many secret places within the land of Barovia, don't forget the **Multiple Ability Checks** rule, found on page 237 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*, which reads as follows:

  

<div class="my-quote" style="font-size: 10px;">

  

<p><em>Sometimes a character fails an ability check and wants to try again. In some cases, a character is free to do so; the only real cost is the time it takes. With enough attempts and enough time, a character should eventually succeed at the task. To speed things up, assume that a character spending ten times the normal amount of time needed to complete a task automatically succeeds at that task. However, no amount of repeating the check allows a character to turn an impossible task into a successful one.</em></p>

  

<p><em>In other cases, failing an ability check makes it impossible to make the same check to do the same thing again. For example, a rogue might try to trick a town guard into thinking the adventurers are undercover agents of the king. If the rogue loses a contest of Charisma (Deception) against the guard's Wisdom (Insight), the same lie told again won't work. The characters can come up with a different way to get past the guard or try the check again against another guard at a different gate. But you might decide that the initial failure makes those checks more difficult to pull off.</em></p>

</div>

  

</blockquote>

  

<div style="height:2px;"></div>

  

##### 1. Balcony

  

This room is largely as described in **Balcony** (p. 214). When the players enter this room, read:

  

<div class="descriptive">

  

You climb the red marble staircase to its full height, arriving at a dusty balcony. The air here is dry and musty, but tinged with a strange, coppery scent. 

  

A suit of black plate armor stands against one wall, draped in cobwebs and marked by age. Oil lamps are mounted on the faded oak-paneled walls, which are carved with woodland scenes of trees, falling leaves, and tiny beasts.

  

</div>

  

When triggered, the **animated armor** will use one or both of its **_multiattack_** attacks to attempt to push a player over the railing using a ***shove*** attack, or attempt to grapple its nearest target before shoving them prone.

  

If the armor is thrown down to the first floor and the players do not reveal their presence atop the balcony, it is unable to observe them with its sixty feet of blindsight, and is too stupid to think to climb back up. 

  

A creature that is pushed over the edge of the balcony falls two stories, or twenty feet, and takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or land prone.

  

\pagebreakNum

  

##### 2. Master Suite

  

When a player first approaches this door, read:

  

<div class="descriptive">

  

These grand doors loom tall, their dark wood frames enclosing a pair of dusty stained-glass windows. Each pane is etched with intricate designs that resemble windmills, their once-vibrant hues now faded and obscured beneath a thick veil of grime.

  

Through the dusty haze that prickles your eyes , you catch a glimpse of something through the windows: a silhouette, standing mere inches behind the glass, lit from behind by a dim, amber glow. It's still and unmoving, but the mere sight of it seizes your muscles in a vice-like grip, your limbs refusing to obey your conscious mind.

  

The air around you thickens, its temperature plummeting to a bone-chilling cold. Your breath fogs the glass panes, a delicate frost creeping across them as the house's distance creaks and whispers are swallowed by a heavy silence.

  

The shadow behind the door is nearly formless—insubstantial—but its presence invokes a primordial dread deep within your marrow. Your heart beats faster, sweat beading on your forehead, pulse racing through your veins. Slowly, the silhouette begins to turn its head toward yours.

  

And then, just as suddenly as it appeared, the shadow evaporates. The biting cold ebbs away, and the house's quiet sounds return once more.

  

</div>

  

This room is largely as described in **Master Suite** (p. 214). When the players enter this room, read:

  

<div class="descriptive">

  

You enter a dusty, cobweb-filled master bedroom with burgundy drapes covering the windows. A four-poster bed with embroidered curtains and tattered gossamer veils stands against the center wall.

  

A door facing the foot of the bed has a faded full-length mirror mounted on it. In the right-hand corner of the roomstands a small wooden door, its surface half-rotted by age. A tarnished metal button is set into the wall beside it.

  

A rotting tiger-skin rug lies on the floor in front of the fireplace, which has a dust-covered portrait of the man and woman from the first-floor portrait hanging above it. A web-filled parlor in the southwest corner contains two chairs and a table holding several items, as well as a door with a dark, dirt-flecked window. 

  

The room also contains a matching pair of wardrobes, a padded chair, and a vanity with a wood-framed mirror and a silver jewelry box. A soft amber glow emanates from beneath the jewelry box's lid.

  

</div>

  

***The Bed.*** A player that approaches the bed can see that a large, bloodstained kitchen knife has been driven into one of the pillows.

  

***The Jewelry Box.*** The jewelry box is empty of valuables. Instead, it is filled with grain, with an *amber shard* resting in the center of the box. (This amber shard is the unique key to the secret door in the **Library**.) 

  

A roll of parchment is half-buried in the grain beside the shard. If unfurled, it reads as follows:

  

<div style="height:2px;"></div>

  

<blockquote>

  

Drasha,

  

I have selected you as the Beast’s custodian in my absence. Should the Beast grow unruly or show signs of agitation while I am away, I have left this amber shard to weaken it and soothe its fury.

  

Should the need arise, present the shard and speak the Beast's name to quiet its tantrums—but be sure to begone from the house before it awakens at midnight.

  

So long as the Beast draws breath, it—not you—is the heart of this house, and no meal shall ever sate its appetite. Should you linger in its domain, it will mean doom for you all.

  

Elisabeth

  

</blockquote>

  

<div style="height:5px;"></div>

  

A player can present the shard and speak Walter's name as a bonus action while within 30 feet of the **flesh mound** in the **Ritual Chamber** (see below) to force the mound to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be dazed until the start of the player's next turn. (A dazed creature can move or take one action on its turn, not both. It also can’t take a bonus action or a reaction.)

  
  

##### 3. Bathroom

  

This room is as described in **Bathroom** (p. 215).

  

##### 4. Storage Room

  

This room is largely as described in **Storage Room** (p. 215). When the players enter it, read:

  

<div class="descriptive">

  

Dusty shelves line the walls of this room. A few of the shelves have folded sheets, blankets, and old bars of soap on them. A cobweb-covered broom leans against the far wall.

  

</div>

  

When a player first approaches within 5 feet of the **broom of animated attack**, it attacks with surprise as soon as they avert their eyes or turn away, thwacking them once upside the head. It then immediately returns to its initial position—now cobweb-free. On its future turns, the broom uses its **_multiattack_** to continue to attack any player not looking at it who remains within 5 feet, foregoing opportunity attacks against players that move away.

  

##### 5. Nursemaid’s Suite

  
  

This room is largely as described in **Nursemaid’s Suite** (p. 217). When the players enter it, read:

  

<div class="descriptive">

  

Dust and cobwebs shroud this elegantly appointed bedroom. A large bed stands against the far wall, its once-opulent coverings now faded and threadbare. 

  

</div>

  

\pagebreakNum

  

<div class="descriptive">

  

Beside the bed, a mildew-covered towel covers most of a dusty yellowed book on one of its two end tables. On the far side of the room, you can see a pair of two more stained-glass doors, their windows flecked with dirt and grime.

  

To the left stands an empty wardrobe, its doors slightly ajar. Mounted beside it stands a full-length mirror, its wooden frame carved to resemble ivy and berries.

  

To the right, an empty doorway leads into a darkened nursery. You can see the silhouette of a crib, its quiet form veiled by a hanging black shroud. A strange substance seems to cover the floor beneath it.

  

As you look around the room, you notice that the blankets atop the bed lift slightly away from the mattress, as though something is lying atop the mattress beneath. As you watch, you can see the coverings, almost imperceptibly, slowly rise and fall with low, rhythmic rustling.

  

</div>

  

***The Bed.*** A player that removes the covers from the bed finds that there is nothing beneath them. Instead, the player only finds a bloodstained mattress and crude hand-and-foot restraints made from barbed wire nailed to the four posts of the bed frame.

  
  

***The Doors.*** A player that exits the bedroom through the stained-glass doors and onto the balcony sees that the town of Daggerford has vanished. Instead, the balcony looks out over an endless, mist-filled chasm.

  
  

***The Book.*** The book is a cobwebbed copy of a raunchy romance novel titled *Blue-Blooded Lips*. It tells the story of a peasant woman's romance with a wealthy duke.

  

***The Nursery.*** If a player enters the nursery, read:

  

<div class="descriptive">

  

The air in this small nursery is strangely warm and tinged with a coppery scent. Blood-red runes cover the walls, arranged in concentric circles around the crib in the center, which seems to have a name carved into its side. Strange, flesh-like tumors have grown along the floor around it in sparse clusters, and slowly pulsate as if they're breathing.

  

Looking down, you notice that a small object seems to have fallen beneath the crib. In the distance, you can faintly hear the sound of an infant's soft whimpering.

  

</div>

  

The object is a severed human finger with several pieces of flesh stripped from it. Tiny toothmarks can be seen around the wounds. A DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check identifies the finger as a woman's, and the teethmarks as a human child's. 

  

The name "Walter" has been lovingly carved into the head of the crib. A successful DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana) identifies the runes around it as dark necromantic magic.

  

***The Mirror.*** The nursemaid’s **specter** does not appear in this room. Instead, when a player approaches the mirror, the nursemaid’s spirit appears as an apparition in the glass.

  

The spirit resembles a pale, skeletally thin young woman, with all of her fingers and toes removed, her eyes sewn shut, and her lips and teeth torn from her mouth. Countless knife-thin scars line her entire body, including the flesh around her wrists and ankles, and her hair has been carelessly hacked to stubble. 

  

Though its appearance is disturbing, players observing the spirit feel that it is simply watching them with shy curiosity.

  

The spirit can neither speak aloud nor exit the mirror. However, it shows no hostility toward the players, and can answer basic questions by nodding or shaking its head. It knows everything that the nursemaid did in life. It shows fear at any mention of Mrs. Durst’s name, sorrow at any mention of Mr. Durst’s, melancholic fondness at any mention of Rose or Thorn, and despair at any mention of Walter.

  

If the players ask the spirit for aid in reaching the basement or finding the “monster,” the spirit steps aside—vanishing from sight—and the secret door behind the mirror slowly swings open. The spirit does not return.

  

#### A2e. The Attic

  

##### 1. Attic Hall

  

This room is largely as described in **Attic Hall** (p. 215). When the players enter this room, read:

  

<div class="descriptive">

  

This bare hall is choked with dust and cobwebs. Several doors lead from this attic corridor, including a door held shut with a padlock.

  

A low creak cuts through the air as one of the unlocked doors slowly creaks open.

  

</div>

  

The door leads to the **Spare Bedroom** (see below).

  

##### 2. Spare Bedroom

  

This room is largely as described in **Spare Bedroom** (p. 215). When the players first enter it, read:

  

<div class="descriptive">

  

This cold, dust-choked room contains a slender bed, a nightstand, a small iron stove, a writing desk with a stool, an empty wardrobe, and a rocking chair. A frowning doll in a lacy yellow dress sits in the northern window box beside a tarnished old music box, cobwebs draping it like a wedding veil.

  

</div>

  

The players can recognize the doll as the same doll that Rose was holding in the family portrait in the Main Hall.

  

The music box contains a rusted, bloodstained skinning knife as well as the key to the padlock on Rose and Thorn's bedroom door.

  

The music box also contains two curled-up pieces of parchment. The first parchment shows a basic floor plan split into three rectangles labeled QUARTERS, SHRINE, and ALTAR. QUARTERS and SHRINE are connected at the top by a single line, and at the bottom by a double line, which connects both to ALTAR. The second parchment contains a list of unfamiliar names beneath the word RECRUITMENT.

  

As the players exit the room, the rocking chair begins to rock softly and the music box opens and begins to play. The sound of motherly humming floats through the air for two measures, but grows off-key and distorted before coming to a violent, screeching halt. The rocking chair then stops rocking.

  

##### 3. Children’s Room

  

This room is largely as described in **Children’s Room** (p. 215-16).

</blockquote>

  

In life, Rose was a budding wizard who discovered a small spellbook in her father’s library, and took great care in copying the _mending_, _light_, and _shocking grasp_ cantrips into her diary.<sup><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/49bvms/notes_from_running_death_house/">4</a></sup>

  

As the ghost children speak with the players, Thorn levitates one of his toys into the air, which falls and breaks. Rose swiftly uses her _mending_ spell to repair it. If her use of magic is remarked upon, she shyly shares her diary’s location, which can be found hidden in the cobweb-covered pillowcase on her bed.

  

In addition to her cantrips, Rose’s aged and faded diary also contains entries regarding her studies, her friends, her younger brother, her nursemaid (“Miss Klara”), and arguments between her mother and father. (Rose doesn't know anything about the content of those fights.)

  

Rose knows the way down to the basement, but “isn’t supposed to go down there.” If the party convinces her to show them the way, she points them toward the dollhouse, revealing the secret entry. In exchange, she asks the players to take her and Thorn's bones with them when they escape, burying them in the garden outside. 

  

The dollhouse contains small dolls that depict tiny, twisted molds of any characters and creatures currently visible in the house. The dolls are made of painted resin. Any character looking inside the dollhouse while in Rose and Thorn’s room can see the appropriately-placed dolls of all living creatures within the manor. The dollhouse only contains rooms within the house itself, and does not depict the dungeon levels below.

  

When the secret door is revealed, Thorn shyly asks the players if he and Rose can accompany them downstairs to aid them, and attempts to possess a friendly player if permitted. When Rose or Thorn attempts to possess a player, describe it as “a child’s tiny hand, desperately seeking the touch of another soul.” 

  

A player possessed by Rose can cast the cantrips in her diary, while a player possessed by Thorn can gain the effects of the _mage hand_ cantrip as an action, without the use of components. (The spectral hand is invisible.)

  

##### 4. Storage Room

  

This room is largely as described in **Storage Room** (p. 215). When the players enter this room, read:

  

<div class="descriptive">

  

This dusty chamber is packed with lumpy, squat shapes draped in dusty white sheets. An old iron stove stands against the right-side wall, next to what looks to be a large trunk covered by a sheet.

  

</div>

  

The nursemaid’s **specter** does not appear in this room. Instead, a character who opens the trunk finds the nursemaid’s corpse, with wounds consistent with those seen on the spirit’s body in the **Nursemaid’s Suite**. A DC 14 Wisdom (Medicine) check reveals that the woman died of starvation.

  

A player inspecting the remains feels a cold breath on their shoulder and the unshakeable sense of being watched. Meanwhile, if another player has previously uncovered a nearby mirror from its sheet covering, that player can see an apparition of Elisabeth Durst within the mirror staring at the player near the chest. Once observed, the apparition swiftly vanishes.

  

**_Milestone_**. Descending into Death House's dungeon level completes a story milestone. When the party gains access to the secret stairs, award each player 200 XP. 

  

##### 5. Guest Bedroom

  

This room is as described in **Spare Bedroom** (p. 215).

  
  

\pagebreakNum

  

##### 6. Secret Stairs

  

This room is largely as described in **Secret Stairs** (p. 217). However, opening the secret door reveals only a stone slab on the opposite side, inset with a small bronze panel at approximately chest level. A small hollow niche identical to the one in the library lies at the panel's center, emanating a faint amber glow. When the niche is exposed, the amber shard from the **Master Suite** glimmers faintly and swings in the air toward it, as though held aloft by an unseen force.

  

To allow the stone slab to swing open and reveal the hidden stairs on the opposite side, the players must place the amber shard into the niche.

  

When the players enter this room, read:

  

<div class="descriptive">

  

The secret door opens to reveal a narrow spiral staircase built of aged-looking wood within a tight shaft of mortared stone. Thick cobwebs fill the staircase as it descends into the darkness below.

  

</div>

  

As the players descend the stairs, read:

  

<div class="descriptive">

  

The broken cobwebs around you sway like a gossamer wedding veil, beckoning you forward as the ancient stairs creak and groan underfoot. The gaping maw of the stairwell draws you deeper, swallowing you up as you descend further down its gullet. You descend one floor—two floors—three.

  

The walls of the stone shaft narrow around you, forcing you to hunch your shoulders and pull in your elbows to continue downward. In the darkness, you can only hear the shuffle of your feet, the choking groan of the stairs, and the pounding of your blood in your ears. 

  

Finally, after what feels like hours, the descent levels out, and the spiral staircase ends at a darkened landing of  packed earth. A narrow tunnel supported by aged timber braces stretches ahead of you, its stone walls seeming to bleed with deposits of streaked, red clay. Eight feet ahead, the tunnel splits, branching to the left and right.

  

</div>

  

<div class="descriptive">

  
  
  

As your eyes and ears adjust to the cold, subterranean corridor, you notice that the tunnel isn't as silent as the staircase above. An eerie, low-pitched sound echoes through the space—and you soon recognize it as a deep, incessant chanting.

As the players approach the **Empty Crypt** and **Walter’s Crypt**, read:

  

<div class="descriptive">

  

This side-corridor branches again to the left and right. On either side, large standing stone slabs have been set aside to lean against the walls, opening the way to a pair of dark, quiet crypts. The slab to the right is etched with the name "Walter Durst"; the slab to the left is blank.

This room is largely as described in **Cult Initiates’ Quarters** (p. 218). 

  

As the characters move to descend to the **Well and Cultist Quarters** (p. 218), a sudden splashing sound can be heard—which then quickly subsides.

  

##### 2. Well and Cultist Quarters

  

This room is largely as described in **Well and Cultist Quarters** (p. 218). When the players enter this room, read:

  
  

<div class="descriptive">

  

The ceiling of this dark, earthen chamber rises a foot higher than the cramped tunnel. It's supported by thick wooden posts and cross beams that have rotted with age and bear deep holes indicative of hungry insects.

  

Here, a lonely well stands at the center of the room, surrounded on three sides by several smaller, alcove-like chambers that have been carved into the walls. Old footprints criss-cross the floor, leading into the alcoves, around the well, up a staircase on the other end of the room, and back upstairs the way you came.

  

An old hempen rope attached to a rusted pulley descends past the mouth of the well, swaying gently in the stagnant air as if just abandoned by an unseen occupant.

  

</div>

  
  

The well comprises a 4-foot-diameter well shaft with a 3-foot-high stone lip, and descends 30 feet to a water-filled cistern. A wooden bucket hangs from a rope-and-pulley mechanism bolted to the cross beams above the well. The interior of the shaft is covered with an ash-black species of fungi.

  

If the players toss an object down the well and then turn away, they hear loud splashing and tearing sounds coming from below. When they turn back, the object has been torn to pieces, with large parts missing.

  

Replace the silvered shortsword in footlocker **25E** with a book bound in grimy black leather. This journal, which one of the cultists kept as a log of the cult’s victims, contains a list of names and physical descriptions associated with each name.

This room is largely as described in **Dining Hall** (p. 218). When the players enter this room, read: 

  

<div class="descriptive">

  

This room contains a plain wooden table flanked by long benches. Moldy humanoid bones lie strewn on the dirt floor.  A thick stench of rot and gore fills the chamber, so coppery with blood that you can taste it on your tongue.

  

A few dozen moldy bones have been piled into a grotesque and misshapen pyramid in a dark alcove to the south.

  

</div>

  

##### 5. Larder

  

This area is largely as described in **Larder** (p. 218). 

  

The **grick** in this alcove—the warped remains of Gustav Durst’s flayed corpse—is coiled on the ceiling, and drops onto its victim when they enter. A DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check allows a player to determine its presence before entering. 

  

\pagebreakNum

  

If the players disturb the grick, read:

  
  
  

<div class="descriptive">

  

A horrific creature—a long, flesh-like worm the breadth and length of a human man—drops from the ceiling. Its flayed muscles split open to reveal a flapping, gaping maw ringed by hundreds of tiny, humanlike teeth and a gnashing, bony beak. 

  

It lets out a high-pitched, gurgling squeal as it hurls itself forward, writhing, tendon-like tentacles lashing toward your face.

</div>

  

##### 6. Ghoulish Encounter

  

This area is largely as described in **Ghoulish Encounter** (p. 218). When the players first approach this area, read: 

  
  
  

<div class="descriptive">

A deathly stench emanates from this corridor. The stone walls bear cracked, red stains, and a trail of old bones leads deeper down the tunnel.

  

</div>

  

<img src="https://www.gmbinder.com/images/k1PgyjB.png" style="width: 100%">

  

When a player first enters one of the 5-foot squares at the entrance of the corridors (marked T on the map), three **ghouls** rise up out of the ground in the spaces marked G and attack.

  

As the ghouls attack, they mindlessly repeat any or all of the following phrases:

  

* “Beautiful. We’re so beautiful.”

* “We are perfect. We are immortal.”

* “Help us live forever.”

  

If the players continue down the corridor, read:

  

<div class="descriptive">

  

The trail ends at the center of a quiet intersection. The incessant chanting you've heard since first entering the dungeon is noticeably louder down the northern branch of the intersection.

##### 7. Stairs Down

  

This room is largely as described in **Stairs Down** (p. 218). When the players approach this area, read:

  

<div class="descriptive">

  

A dark set of chiseled stone steps descends into darkness. It's clear that the origin of the muffled chanting you've been hearing lies below.

</div>

  

##### 8. Darklord’s Shrine

  

This room is largely as described in **Darklord’s Shrine** (p. 218). When the players enter this room, read:

  

<div class="descriptive">

  

This room is festooned with moldy skeletons that hang from rusty shackles against the walls, their mouths hanging open in silent screams. 

  

A wide alcove in the south wall contains a painted wooden statue carved in the likeness of a gaunt, pale-faced man wearing a voluminous black cloak, his pale left hand resting on the head of a wolf that stands beside him. The statue's right hand holds a smoky-gray crystal orb, and its painted gaze stares down toward you, a cold and cruel glint to its eye.

  

Five ashen shadows are burned into the walls, with soot marks stretching across the floor toward the statue.

  

The room has exits to the west and north. Chanting can be heard coming from the west.

  

</div>

  

A player that approaches the orb can hear many voices whispering the following phrases:

  

* “His gaze burns upon us.”

* “The Darklord’s eyes are always watching.”

  

Additionally, that player’s shadow begins to writhe and twist, its edges growing tattered and blurred as it lashes erratically across the floor. A player who touches the orb feels as though a “dark, ancient evil” has suddenly turned its eye upon them. 

  

If the orb is removed from its position, the ashen **shadows** upon the walls begin to stir. Each round, up to two of the shadows “awaken,” swooping across the walls. As they awaken, they murmur and moan the following phrases:

  

* “Begone from this place!”

* “Look not upon us.”

* “Return the Darklord’s offering!”

  

Once all shadows have awoken, they attack, with each shadow preferring to target a different player. If the orb is returned to its place on the statue, the shadows return to their original positions and become dormant once more.

  
  

If the players approach the door leading to **Cult Leaders’ Den**, read:

  

<div class="descriptive">

  

This old wooden door is covered in ancient red stains.

<div class="descriptive">

  

The half-eaten body of a rat lies at its base, its head torn off and half of the spine poking from its severed lower torso. 

  

</div>

  

Any creature that touches the door becomes adhered to it, whereupon the **mimic** attacks. The mimic also attacks if its takes any damage.

  

When the mimic attacks, the victim's hand is sucked inside of it. The door then deforms, sprouting dozens of mouths and eyes, with the nearest mouth attempting to bite down on the now-stuck victim.

  

If the **mimic** is attacked at range by a wary or alerted PC, it flees, vanishing around the corner and reappearing as a door, chest, or longsword elsewhere in the dungeon.

  

##### 9. Hidden Trapdoor

  

This room is largely as described in **Hidden Trapdoor** (p. 219). When the players find and enter this area, read:

  
  

<div class="descriptive">

  

The clay staircase ends at a cramped landing. Six feet above the ground, a half-rotted ceiling of close-fitting planks holds a closed wooden trapdoor leading to an upper floor. The trapdoor is bolted shut from this side.

This room is largely as described in **Cult Leaders’ Den** (p. 219). When the players enter this room, read:

  

<div class="descriptive">

  

This quiet room contains a wooden table flanked by two high-backed chairs and holding a clay jug and two flagons. Above the table is suspended an unlit cast-iron chandelier. Iron candlesticks stand in two corners of the chamber, their candles long since melted away. A short corridor at the north end of the room leads to a darkened chamber beyond.

See **Darklord’s Shrine** for more information on running the **mimic** here.

  
  

##### 11. Cult Leader’s Quarters

  

This room is largely as described in **Cult Leaders’ Quarters** (p. 219). When the players enter this room, read:

  

<div class="descriptive">

  

This room contains a large wood-framed bed, the feather mattress rotted by years of disuse. An old wooden wardrobe carved with demonic faces stands against the wall to the left, and a faded wooden footlocker stands quietly at the foot of the bed.

  

</div>

  

<div class="descriptive">

  

The room is suffused with a familiar stench of death—but far stronger, mixing with a noxious scent that fills your lungs with every breath.

</div>

  
  

The wardrobe contains several old robes, a pair of iron candlesticks, and an open crate containing thirty torches and a leather sack with fifteen candles inside it. A rotting aroma also emanates from a pair of rotted organs—a half-eaten liver and a gnawed intestine—lying hidden beneath the hems of the robes.

  

Folded inside the foot locker, on top of its other contents, is a **boneless** (_Van Richten’s Guide to Ravenloft_, p. 228) made of the recognizable flayed skin of Gustav Durst. When the foot locker is opened, the **boneless** springs out to attack the nearest creature.

  

No **ghasts** attack if a player removes any items from the foot locker, and there are no hidden cavities behind the walls.

##### 1. Reliquary

  

This room is largely as described in **Reliquary** (p. 219). When the players enter this room, read:

  

<div class="descriptive">

  

The dusty stone steps descend past a landing and around a bend until they end at a cold, rectangular chamber. A thin, wafting mist clings to the ground, and the wooden cross beams that support the ceiling groan beneath the weight of the house and underground complex above. 

  

The walls of this room are cut with small, chiseled alcoves, each holding a strange, ghastly trinket or relic. A corridor with a sagging ceiling exits the chamber and bends out of sight to the right. Past it, you can see a stone slope that descends into black, murky water. The ghostly chant you've heard since entering the basement is strongest here, and seems to be emanating from the other side of a rusted, closed portcullis.

  

You can finally understand the words.

  

They say, over and over again, in a ceaseless refrain:

  

"He is the Ancient."

  

"He is the Land."

This area is largely as described in **Portcullis** (p. 219). When the players approach this area, read:

  

<div class="descriptive">

  

The floor is submerged beneath two feet of dark, murky water that sloshes around your calves and boots. The tunnel forward is blocked by a rusty iron portcullis.

The mound’s statistics are then instantly replaced by the statistics of its second form. Its initiative count doesn’t change.

> ___

> ### Actions

> ***Multiattack.*** The flesh mound makes two Slam attacks. If it has a Medium or smaller creature grappled, the flesh mound then uses its Engulf on it.

>

> ***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (2d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage. If the attack hits a Medium or smaller target, the target is grappled (escape DC 13).

>

> ***Engulf.*** The flesh mound engulfs a Medium or smaller creature grappled by it. The engulfed target is blinded, restrained, and unable to breathe, and it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of the mound’s turns or take 8 (2d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage. If the mound moves, the engulfed target moves with it. The mound can only have one creature engulfed at a time.

  

The wooden wheel that opens the portcullis remains on the western side of the gate (i.e., the side facing the **Ritual Chamber**). However, the chain-link mechanism to open the portcullis has broken, preventing the players from proceeding without repairing it (e.g., by using Rose’s _mending_ cantrip) or lifting the portcullis by hand. (If the players lift the portcullis by hand and then release it, its weight causes it to shut once more unless propped open.)

  

\columnbreak

  

##### 4. Ritual Chamber

  

This room is largely as described in **Ritual Chamber** (p. 219). When the players enter this room, read:

  
  
  

<div class="descriptive">

  

The smooth masonry walls of this forty-foot-square room provide excellent acoustics. Featureless stone pillars support the ceiling, and murky water covers most of the floor. Stairs lead up to dry stone ledges that hug the walls. In the middle of the room, more stairs rise to form an octagonal dais that also rises above the water. Rusty chains with shackles dangle from the ceiling directly above a stone altar mounted on the dais. The altar is carved with hideous depictions of grasping ghouls and is stained with dry blood. A small, white bundle lies atop it, surrounded by pulsating, fleshy tendrils.

  

The tendrils run to a breach in the far wall that leads to a dark cave, their fleshy masses connecting to a dark, hulking shadow that lies within, its bloated mass rising and falling with a slow, shuddering rhythm.

  

As soon as you step foot into the chamber, the ghostly chanting you've heard suddenly falls silent.

  

</div>

  

A player that approaches the altar sees that the words "FEED HIM" are carved into its flat stone surface just below the white bundle, surrounded by several fleshy tendrils inset with human teeth. The tendrils belong to the **flesh mound** (see below), which awakens and attacks if the tendrils are damaged.

  

The bundle atop the altar is the size and shape of an infant wrapped in swaddling clothes. If unwrapped, the players instead find it to hold a rusted, serrated dagger stained red with ancient blood.

  

The dark shadow in the cave is a **flesh mound** containing Walter’s spirit and remains.<sup><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/8sfpkn/fleshing_out_curse_of_strahd_part_2_entering/">1</a></sup> It is a swollen, bloated mound of bones, flesh, and gore that seems to breathe as its mass rises and falls. A player that observes it concludes that it appears to be sleeping.

  

The cultists' shadows described in **“One Must Die!”** (p. 220) do not appear when a player climbs the altar. Instead, the players have two choices: sacrifice a living creature on the altar, or attack the flesh mound.

  

If a creature is sacrificed on the altar, the flesh mound's tendrils accept its corpse and pull it to the mound's lair. There, the mound messily devours it before returning its tendrils to the altar once more. Feeding the mound does not free the players, because its hunger cannot be sated.

  

The flesh mound awakens if attacked. When it does, its subsequent screeching wail causes the earth to tremble, sending the **Portcullis** crashing to the ground if it's been opened and damaging the mechanism responsible for opening it.

  
  
  

In combat, the flesh mound begins in its **first form**. For one minute after it has awoken, the flesh mound’s **_heavy sleeper_** feature prevents it from using its ***multiattack*** actions in either form.

  

A creature engulfed by the mound’s first form can hear the faint sound of a baby crying at the center of its swollen bulk.

  
  
  

\pagebreakNum

  

<blockquote>

  

<h5>Elisabeth's Amber Shard</h5>

  

Remember that a player in possession of Elisabeth's amber shard from the **Master Suite** can present the shard and speak the name "Walter" while within 30 feet of the **flesh mound**, forcing the mound to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be dazed until the start of the player's next turn. (A dazed creature can move or take one action on its turn, not both. It also can’t take a bonus action or a reaction.)

  

</blockquote>

  

#### A2h. Escape From Death House

  

When the **flesh mound** dies, the players can hear the sound of the house’s front door opening far overhead, and the distant thunderstorm beyond.

  
  
  

When the players next begin to move toward the exit, read:

  

<div class="descriptive">

  

A guttural moan ripples through the air—and a terrifying apparition manifests before you: the spirit of Elisabeth Durst, her once-beautiful features now grotesquely distorted. Her lustrous hair is a wild, disheveled mess, her skin a deathly pallor, and her lips peeling back to reveal sharp, yellowed teeth. An amber shard glows ominously on a cord around her spectral neck, a shadowed wisp swirling within its depths.

  

The spirit levitates high above the floor, sunken eyes blazing with malice and mouth twisted into a snarl. "You may have evaded my pet," it rasps, "but I will tear this house apart before I let you escape." It throws its head back and lets loose a blood-curdling scream that reverberates across the stone walls—and sets the very foundations of the house trembling.

  

Far above, the grandfather clock begins to chime, the sound mounting to a thunderous cacophony. Dust and debris rain down as the floor shakes beneath you, the wooden cross beams of the ceiling starting to splinter and crack. Elisabeth's spirit fixes you with a feral grin—and then dissipates into thin air, leaving only echoes of its spiteful laugher as the house rumbles, shifts, and groans.

The players must flee from the ritual chamber to the **Entrance** of Death House before the entire structure collapses upon their heads. However, they don't need to roll initiative, and the architectural changes described in **The Cult is Denied** are not present. 

  

Instead, as the players escape the crumbling Death House, they face two additional obstacles.

  

***Gustav's Ghost.*** As the players move to exit the **Reliquary**, the ghost of Gustav Durst (use the statistics of a **poltergeist**, but without its ***invisibility*** feature) confronts them. Read:

  

<div class="descriptive">

  

An ethereal apparition appears before you, obstructing the stairs—the ghost of a man. He is a gaunt and pale figure, with sunken, haunted eyes and trembling hands, wearing once-fine clothing now tattered with age.

  

"Please," the spirit says, tears beading at the corners of his eyes. "You have to stay here and die. She won't accept anything else."

  

</div>

  

The spirit is recognizable as Gustav Durst. Gustav pleads with the players to give up, insisting that Elisabeth's spirit is simply too powerful—too fearsome—to disobey. A DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals that Gustav is terrified of Elisabeth—and ridden with guilt, doubt, and self-loathing.

  

If the players attempt to bypass or attack Gustav, a swarm of levitating debris and shrapnel arises around him. He pleads with the players again, insisting that he doesn't want to fight them, but that he doesn't know that he has any other choice.

  

The players can convince Gustav to step aside with a successful DC 20 Charisma (Intimidation) check. Alternatively, if the players reference Gustav's history with Elisabeth and Klara, they can convince him to stand aside with a DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check, succeeding automatically if they show him empathy or kindness.

  

If the players successfully persuade Gustav to stand aside, he warns them that "her other servants" are lying in wait ahead to block the players' escape. "Don't fear them," he says. "Their only power is fear." He then vanishes.

  

***The Cult's Return*** When the players first reach the **Family Crypts** or (if they have previously found and opened the hidden trapdoor described in **32. Hidden Trapdoor**, p. 219) the **Darklord's Shrine**, the spirits of the cult arise to stop them. Read:

  

<div class="descriptive">

  

The changing rises once more as thirteen dark apparitions appear around you, obstructing the way forward—as well as the way back. Each one resembles a black-robed figure holding a torch, but the torch's fire is black and seems to draw light into it. Where you'd expect to see faces are voids. "He is the Ancient!" they chant, over and over. "He is the Land!"

  

</div>

  

The apparitions are harmless and intangible figments that can't be damaged, turned, or dispelled. At the end of each round, each player that remains between the apparitions must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 2 (1d4) bludgeoning damage from falling debris.

  

\columnbreak

  

#### A2i. Outside Death House

  

When the players exit Death House, the storm overhead has slowed to a mere drizzle, and the mists around the house have disappeared. Night has long since fallen, and the waning moon is high in the sky.

  

Most surprisingly, the players now find themselves in a dark forest clearing at the beginning of the **Old Svalich Road** (p. 33), rather than in the streets of Daggerford. The road travels west. To the east lie dark, endless woods filled with the **Mists of Ravenloft** (p. 23).

  

The house then collapses into the earth, leaving a dark and bottomless pit behind. If the players still have it, Elisabeth Durst's amber shard then crumbles into dust. The pit vanishes the first time the players depart the clearing.

  

If they’re still possessing the players, Rose and Thorn’s spirits end their possessions. The children remark that the woods look like their home—Barovia.

  

As the players explore their surroundings, they can quickly see the top of an old, ruined stone tower poking up through the treetops. The architecture of the tower is as described in **Will-o'-Wisp** (p. 33), but the interior is not desecrated ground, there is no wooden chest on the ground, and there are no **zombies** or **will-o'-wisps** inside or around the tower.

  

The players can easily surmise that this ruin appears to be a safe place to spend the night. Rose and Thorn offer to serve as sentries while the players rest, watching the woods and awakening the players should any threats emerge.

  

The night passes without issue. When the players awaken the following morning, Rose and Thorn ask the players if they can bury their remains before proceeding any further, so that they can finally rest. (The children's spirits will not proceed further into Barovia, instead pleading for the players to allow them to rest.) If the players bury their remains here, the children’s spirits thank them before vanishing.

  

The players can find the beginning of the Old Svalich Road a short ways through the woods away from the tower. **Arc B: Welcome to Barovia** then begins.

  

**_Milestone_**. Escaping Death House completes a story milestone. When the party begins their first long rest after escaping the house, award each player 400 XP. (This should allow the players to advance to 3rd level.)

  
  

##### Death House Design Notes

***The Arrival.*** The illusory Rose and Thorn have been intentionally removed from this version of Death House in order to ensure that the players enter the house of their own volition and trust the real Durst children upon meeting them.

  

The countdown and poem have been added to provide the players with a clear sense of direction and purpose while exploring the house, and to prevent the players from taking a long rest (and therefore disrupting the balance of subsequent combat encounters) while doing so.

  

***The First Floor.*** The feast in the dining room has been made intentionally harmless in order to encourage the players to trust the safety of Strahd's dinner invitation when they later receive it. Additional clues have been added to convey to the players the relationships within the Durst family, including Mr. Durst's affair.

  

***The Second Floor.*** Clues have been added to ease the discovery of the library's secret room and to convey the depth of Mr. Durst's affair, as well as the nursemaid's pregnancy.

  

\pagebreakNum

  

The dog Lancelot, a popular community character, has been intentionally cut from Death House to avoid providing the players with an easy sacrifice to make at the altar in the ritual chamber—a sacrifice that is no longer functional (because the cult no longer releases the players upon making a sacrifice) and which rings hollow when compared to the campaign that procedes it (because Strahd's "hunger" cannot be sated.)

  

***The Third Floor.*** The nursemaid's specter now serves as a vital tool that allows the players to find the attic staircase without undue frustration or delay. Additional clues have been added to convey the fate of Walter, Mr. Durst, and the nursemaid.

  

***The Attic.*** Clues have been added to convey the nursemaid's fate and the founding of Mrs. Durst's cult.

  

***The Dungeon.*** Several of the encounters in this area have been changed to reduce the probability of a TPK and to teach the players to act cautiously and make wise decisions. In the ritual chamber, the cult is no longer willing to accept the sacrifice of a beast (e.g., Lancelot), foreshadowing that Strahd will not be content with Ireena alone. The **shambling mound** has been replaced by a two-stage **flesh mound**, whose statistics have been calibrated to provide a challenging fight without risking a TPK.

  

***Escape From Death House.*** The original "escape from Death House" sequence has been replaced with a pair of social encounters that reward the players for investigating the history of the house, and which serve to foreshadow the characterizations of Sergi von Zarovich, Lady Fiona Wachter, and Strahd's brides and servants in the adventure to come.

  

The frequent community addition of a skill challenge to escape the house has been removed to ensure a smooth and simple transition from the flesh mound's death to the players' exit from the house, to remove any friction with players who may struggle to learn the mechanics of a new system of gameplay in the heat of the moment, and to preserve the players' immersion in the narrative of the escape, rather than its gameplay.

  

This guide has intentionally foregone a popular community addition that places a bottle of wine—courtesy of Strahd—at or near the exit of the house. Strahd is not omniscient, and the players' efforts to avoid or foil his spies will prove a recurring aspect of gameplay through the adventure. Moreover, Death House is too far from Barovia proper for Strahd to have obtained and delivered a fresh bottle of wine to its location. A villain is only as evocative as their limitations, and Strahd has many. Finally, it is an intentional design choice of this guide that the players do not encounter Strahd directly until their meeting at the River Ivlis Crossroads, which ensures that their relationship with Strahd before then is built solely on rumor, second-hand knowledge, and superstition. Earlier direct exposure would wholly spoil this effect.

## Arc A. Escape From Death House

The players begin in the town of Thistlehold on the night before Highharvesttide, an annual feast and holiday celebration. The local inns are full for the night, and the players—vagabonds with little coin or company to speak of—find shelter in the stable of the Nightmare’s Bridle, a ramshackle tavern on the outskirts of town. 

When the relics they carry sense the presence of Death House, however, the players are led through Thistlehold’s rainy streets and into the house’s waiting threshold.

Once inside, the players are trapped and told that a monster will hunt them down once it awakens. They have six hours to find it first and either appease it with a suitable sacrifice—or kill it. As they explore the house, they come to learn the house’s lurid history, as well as the true identity of the beast that lurks beneath.

If the players kill the monster, the house begins to collapse, forcing them to flee or be lost in the rubble. Upon emerging, they find that their surroundings have changed, transporting them to the darkened land of Barovia.

### A1. Thistlehold 

#### A1a. The Nightmare’s Bridle

If one or more of your players are using the ***Barovian Relics*** hook, read the following text. Otherwise, proceed to ***A2. Death House*** below.

*It’s the evening before Highharvesttide, and a storm has descended over Thistlehold, with dark clouds pouring cascades of rain down upon the town below. Despite the weather, however, the town buzzes with anticipation of the impending falltime festival, each home filled with warmth and joy. Bright, cheery candlelight twinkles from every window, and the sounds of song and dance echo throughout the wet and muddy streets.*

*Amidst the merriment, however, you stand apart. Neither locals nor visitors, you’re vagabonds—travelers, ghosts passing through an unfamiliar town. As laughter rings out from inns and homes, you face a simpler, starker dilemma: the quest for shelter.*

*Every room in this town is claimed, every hearth filled to bursting, leaving you in the grip of the bitter storm. Until, that is, the owner of the ramshackle Nightmare’s Bridle tavern offers you a grudging reprieve: the hayloft above their stable. It’s nothing to boast about, leaving the biting cold and the lingering scent of musty hay as your only companions. But it’s a roof over your heads nonetheless—a small mercy on a night such as this.*

*One by one, you find a home amidst the muck and hay. Overhead, rain lashes the stable, thunder punctuating the rhythmic drumming on the roof. Flashes of lightning lance across the skies, casting the stable’s interior in stark lights and darks. Rainwater drips steadily down through a leak in the roof, snaking its way across the floor until it pools in the corner.*

*Here, then, you find yourselves: huddled in the darkness amongst strangers, while joy and mirth dance just out of reach.*

Invite the players to describe each character's appearance and countenance, how they’ve positioned themselves, and how they’ve arranged their belongings.

When the players have finished introducing themselves, read:

*A searing bolt of lightning rends the sky, illuminating the evening in a blinding flash of stark white. The booming thunder that follows is so loud it shakes the very ground beneath you, causing the timbers of the stable to creak and groan.*

*The light of the strike lingers unnaturally, silhouetting small wisps of fog that twist through the air. A thick, ankle-deep mist gathers outside, shrouding the earth in a ghostly veil. Its tendrils curl invitingly, as though beckoning you to the darkness beyond.*

*The rain continues to pelt the roof above, but the wind no longer howls, and the merry sounds of Daggerford’s festivities seem muted and distant. The horses in the stable beneath stir uneasily, their whinnies echoing loudly in the stillness. An uneasy feeling sweeps through the hayloft, a cold shiver that has nothing to do with the wind or rain.*

One by one, the players’ relics then react as follows, in the following order.

* ***Stone Crest.*** The crest emits a low hum and smells of pine needles and earthy soil, which both grow stronger when the crest is moved toward Death House.
* ***Broken Blade.*** The blade emits a high-pitched hum and begins to tremble violently, spinning like a compass needle in the direction of Death House.
* ***Dragon's Scale.*** The scale burns icy cold, one end glowing with a bright, silver light in the direction of Death House.
* ***Sunrise Medallion.*** The medallion shines with a warm, golden glow, emitting rays of bright light in the direction of Death House.
* ***Amber Shard.*** The shard glows with amber light and tugs its cord in the direction of Death House.
* ***Wolf's Tooth.*** The tooth lengthens, glowing with silver moonlight, and tugs its cord in the direction of Death House.
* ***Crumpled Page.*** The ink on the page glows with amber light, the runes reshaping themselves into a map that shows the page's location—and an arrow that guides toward Death House.
* ***Tattered Banner.*** The sound of war-drums fills the air, and the banner blows in an unseen wind in the direction of Death House.
* ***Electrum Coin.*** The coin lands on its edge and begins rolling across the muddy cobblestones in the direction of Death House.
* ***Angel's Feather.*** The feather is swept away by an unseen wind, its barbs glimmering with golden light as it twirls through the streets toward Death House.
* ***Raven's Feather.*** The feather is swept away by the wind, its shadow seeming to dance in the air, as it twirls through the streets toward Death House.
* ***Wanderer's Scarf.*** The scarf is carried away by the wind, its patterns shifting and turning in the air as it whirls through the streets toward Death House.


If the players give chase, read:

*You emerge from the hayloft into the swirling mists beyond, the stones of Daggerford's streets slick and gleaming beneath your feet. The city’s laughter and cheer is now but a hollow echo, the brightness of its revelry drowned in the fog that encircles you. The taste of the cold, damp air is sharp on your tongue, and the sound of your own breath loud in your ears. 

*Your relics call you forward, the mists parting to make way. You move slowly at first, then faster, your hearts pounding in your chest. As you venture deeper into the fog, each step you make feels heavier, each echo of thunder a beat in this relentless march.

*The fog swallows the town, buildings reduced to looming shadows, their shapes dancing and flickering in the storm's sporadic flashes of lightning. Rain drums a relentless rhythm, the patter of drops on cobblestone accompanying the distant, mournful peal of thunder. For brief moments, you can feel something else beneath your feet: the steady pounding of a deep and distant heartbeat.

*You're pulled left, then right, then left again, the relics guiding you through the murky labyrinth. Distance and direction have lost all meaning, the shadows around you contorting in twisted shapes. Your blood sings in your ears, and the air grows denser, electric, as the energy of the storm—of the chase—swells with reckless abandon.

*And then—the pounding stops.

*The thunder pauses.

*And the mist breaks.

*The fog pulls back like a curtain, revealing a tall, eerie silhouette that towers in the gloom before you.

This is **Death House.**

### A2. Death House

If one or more of your players are using the ***Lost in the Mists*** hook, read the following text. Otherwise, proceed to ***A2a. The Arrival*** below.

*Highharvesttide in Daggerford. It’s a time of joy and celebration, of hearth and home, of golden laughter ringing out into the night. But tonight, as a storm has swept over the town, you find yourselves apart from the warmth and revelry, drawn into the cold, dark embrace of mystery.

*As mercenaries, you're no strangers to danger or the unknown. But this—this is different. Over the past few weeks, whispers have spread throughout Daggerford of disappearances: ordinary folk, vanished without a trace.
The only connection? A grand, old manor, known in hushed tones as “Death House.”

*Tonight, as the storm rages outside, you've been summoned to investigate this mysterious dwelling. The town crier’s proclamation still echoes in your ears, a bounty for any brave souls who dare to uncover the truth. Driven by a mix of greed, curiosity, and perhaps a touch of bravado, you stepped forward.

*Now, guided by the faint glow of your lanterns, you traverse the slick, fog-shrouded cobblestone streets. The distant merriment is a stark contrast to the eerie quiet around you. The world has been reduced to hushed whispers and the steady drumming of rain, a somber serenade to your perilous journey.

*And then, as if answering an unspoken summons, the mists before you part, revealing the grim silhouette of your destination: the “Death House.” Its dark, stone façade and towering spires loom ominously against the storm-tossed sky, a wordless challenge against your resolve.
#### A2a. The Arrival

##### Entrance

Read all players the following text:

*A grand manor stands before you, four stories of cold, soot-stained stone, tall narrow windows, and high peaked roofs forming a picture of austere, chilling grandeur. Midway up, a narrow balcony juts out from the third floor, offering a grim perch from which to survey the surrounding grounds.

*The centerpiece of this imposing facade is the portico, a stone arch standing sentinel before the house's oaken doors. A wrought-iron gate fills this arch, its rusty hinges creaking as it sways in the wind. 

*On either side of the gate, oil lamps hang from chains, their light dim and flickering, casting a sickly glow that barely pierces the surrounding fog.

*Beyond the gate, a set of sturdy oaken doors stand closed, framed by the gate and the lamps. The doors are old and weathered, their wood darkened by time, but they stand strong and and proud—an unwelcome entrance to the house beyond.

*A gust of wind sweeps past you, carrying with it a whisper of cold dread that sends shivers down your spine.

Any players who began with the ***Barovian Relics*** hook can now see the players who began with the ***Lost in the Mists*** hook, and vice-versa. (If any of the players’ relics flew or rolled to Death House—as with the ***wanderer’s scarf*** or the ***electrum coin***—they land on the house’s threshold, just beyond the portico.) The street is otherwise deserted.

The entrance beyond the portico is otherwise as described in **1. Entrance** (p. 212).
		A wrought-iron gate with hinges on one side and a lock on the other fills the archway of a stone portico (area lA). The gate is unlocked, and its rusty hinges shriek when the gate is opened. Oil lamps hang from the portico ceiling by chains, flanking a set of oaken doors that open into a grand foyer (area lB).
		Hanging on the south wall of the foyer is a shield emblazoned with a coat-of-arms (a stylized golden windmill on a red field), flanked by framed portraits of stony-faced aristocrats (Jong-dead members of the Durst family). Mahogany-framed double doors leading from the foyer to the main hall (area 2A) are set with panes of stained glass.
<div style="height: 1px"></div>

> ##### Strahd & the Cult
>
> The cult of Death House earned no love from Strahd in life. But in death, the two parties have come to an informal, unspoken understanding. In exchange for the permission to roam far afield from the misty land of Barovia to claim sacrifices, Death House is bound to return to the valley after each hunting excursion. Should any adventurers successfully escape the house's bloodied altar, they inevitably emerge into Strahd's domain—assuring him of a worthy crop of prey to pursue.

<div style="height: 1px"></div>

##### Main Hall

When the players pass through Death House’s threshold, any Barovian relics they carry cease to be active. (For example, the *sunrise medallion* ceases to glow.)

The main hall is largely as described in **Main Hall** (p. 212)
		A wide hall (area 2A) runs the width of the house, with a black marble fireplace at one end and a sweeping, red marble staircase at the other. Mounted on the wall above the fireplace is a longsword (nonmagical) with a windmill cameo worked into the hilt. The wood-paneled walls are ornately sculpted with images of vines, flowers, nymphs, and satyrs. Characters who search the walls for secret doors or otherwise inspect the paneling can, with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check, see serpents and skulls inconspicuously woven into the wall designs. The decorative paneling follows the staircase as it circles upward to the second floor. A cloakroom (area 2B) has several black cloaks hanging from hooks on the walls. A top hat sits on a high shelf.


 but now contains a grandfather clock, which is placed in the circular space at the base of the stairs.

Instead of a longsword, the portrait of the Durst family from **6. Upper Hall** (p. 213)
		Hanging above the mantelpiece is a wood-framed portrait of the Durst family: Gustav and Elisabeth Durst with their two smiling children, Rose and Thorn. Cradled in the father's arms is a swaddled baby, which the mother regards with a hint of scorn.
 now hangs above the fireplace. In the portrait, Rose is holding a smiling doll wearing a yellow lace dress. A plaque beneath the portrait reads: *Mr. Gustav and Mrs. Elisabeth Durst, with their two children, Rosavalda and Thornboldt.*<sup>1</sup>

Shortly after all of the characters enter the main hall, the front door slams shut, extinguishing all lights in the house. The sound of the rain outside completely vanishes, leaving the house eerily silent. 

Bloody letters then begin appearing on the southern wall, just above the marble staircase. They read as follows:

***Beneath this dwelling lurks a beast<br>
Who hungers for a bloody feast.<br>
He sleeps until the midnight chime<br>
Then wakes to feed his dark design.<br>
If morsels seek to flee their doom,<br>
Then bring toward his secret room<br>
A gift to soothe his savage mood<br>
But mind the servants of his brood.

The grandfather clock then strikes six o’clock.

A player who opens any outside-facing door or curtain in Death House finds that the exterior of the house has been completely bricked up, trapping the players inside. A player who takes the time to break through the bricks finds only more bricks on the other side.

#### A2b. The First Floor

##### Cloakroom

A player who investigates the cloakroom adjoining the Main Hall can observe an envelope poking from the pocket of one of the cloaks. The envelope, which is addressed to Lady Lovina Wachter, contains an invitation. It reads:

<blockquote style="text-align:center;">

You are cordially invited to join 

<div style="height: 3px;"></div>

**MR. GUSTAV & ELISABETH DURST**

<div style="height: 3px;"></div>

for a celebration of the one-year anniversary of the Durst Mill. 


<div style="height: 3px;"></div>

***The Durst Residence, Barovia Village***

<div style="height: 3px;"></div>

6 o'clock p.m.
<br>
13 Neyavr, 348

<div style="height: 3px;"></div>

*Dinner and refreshments to be served.*

</blockquote>

##### Den of Wolves

This room is largely as described in **Den of Wolves** (p. 212). 
		This oak-paneled room looks like a hunter's den. Mounted above the fireplace is a stag's head, and positioned around the outskirts of the room are three stuffed wolves.Two padded chairs draped in animal furs face the hearth, with an oak table between them supporting a cask of wine, two carved wooden goblets, a pipe rack, and a candelabrum. A chandelier hangs above a cloth-covered table surrounded by four chairs.
		Two cabinets stand against the walls. The east cabinet sports a lock that can be picked with thieves' tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. It holds a heavy crossbow, a light crossbow, a hand crossbow, and 20 bolts for each weapon. The north cabinet is unlocked and holds a small  Box containing a deck of playing cards and an assortment of wine glasses.
		TRAPDOOR
		A trapdoor is hidden in the southwest corner of the Door. It can't be detected or opened until the characters approach it from the underside (see area 32). Until then, Death House supernaturally hides the trapdoor.
As the players enter this room, read:

<div class="descriptive">

As you crack the door to this room open, you catch a glimpse of something feral beyond: an amber eye that flashes in the darkness, and a bestial muzzle curled into a snarl.
</div>



If the players proceed, read:

<div class="descriptive">

The door cracks open, revealing a gray-furred wolf frozen into place. It's only a moment before you realize that it's not moving—and another before you realize that it's not alone. 

This oak-paneled room looks like a hunter's den. Mounted above the fireplace is a stag's head, and positioned around the outskirts of the room are two additional stuffed wolves—a large gray wolf and a smaller brown wolf.

Two padded chairs draped in animal furs face a hearth, with an oak table between them supporting an assortment of objects. A chandelier hangs above a cloth-covered table surrounded by four chairs, and two cabinets stand against the walls. A pair of small toys seems to have been forgotten beneath one of the chairs.
</div>

The discarded toys are small, plush gray wolves, whose threadbare coats show evidence of heavy mending and patchwork. Clusmy stitchwork on their stomachs reads ROSE and THORN, respectively.

In addition to its other contents, the east cabinet contains three silvered crossbow bolts mixed in with the other twenty bolts. Meanwhile, the west cabinet also contains a mounted piece of child's needlework that depicts a boy and girl holding the hands of a young woman, alongside clumsily stitched words that read FOR MISS KLARA. The young woman's face has been slashed and cut out.

The first time that no players are looking at them, the three taxidermied wolves move. When the players next look at them, the large gray wolf is standing beside the smaller brown wolf, and the first gray wolf has turned its snarl toward the others.

A player that succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (Nature) check can identify the large gray wolf as male and the other two as female.



<blockquote>

<h5>Time in Death House</h5>

When the clock strikes six, place three six-sided dice on the table in front of the players, with each side showing a six. Each pip on the dice represents twenty minutes until midnight. 

As the players explore the house, tick this dice clock downward to indicate the passage of time, always starting with the die showing the lowest number. If the lowest die shows a one, you can tick it down to “zero” by removing it from the group instead.

The dice clock counts down as follows:

* Each time the players enter a new floor of the house or dungeon, tick the dice clock down by one.
* Each time the players make a Perception or Investigation check to search an entire room, tick the dice clock down by one.
* Each time the players complete a short rest, tick the dice clock down by three.

The grandfather clock in the **Main Hall** sounds on the hour, every hour, and can be heard throughout the house and dungeon. 

When the clock strikes midnight, the **flesh mound** in the **Ritual Chamber** awakens and makes a beeline for the players, exiting through the **Hidden Trapdoor** into the **Den of Wolves** if necessary to reach them. At least one minute should pass between the time the mound wakes up and the time that it first reaches the players, nullifying its ***heavy sleeper*** feature and allowing it to use its ***multiattack*** actions.

<div style="height: 2px;"></div>

<h5>Resting in Death House</h5>

Due to their midnight deadline, it is impossible for the players to take a long rest in Death House. However, the players might still need to take a short rest. Each time they do so in the main house, they experience one or more of the following hauntings:

* A player hears rats scrabbling up and down the spaces between the walls. A thick, choking stench of rot seeps into the room.
* A player hears the sound of a woman’s humming emanating from the opposite side of a closed door. If the door is cracked open, a cold blue eye stares back before vanishing.
* A player hears footsteps descending from the attic, which stop outside of their door before moving away to the library. Soon after, a grinding noise can be heard coming from the library—the sound of the secret door.
* A player hears maniacal laughter echoing from far below the house.
* A player hears a pleading female voice in their right ear that swears that “it isn’t his.” Another, colder female voice in the player’s left ear scoffs and says, "You would say that, you little *harlot*."
</blockquote>
##### Dining Room

Players that approach this door can hear the muffled sound of a lively dinner feast, including clinking glasses, quiet laughter, and distant conversation. If the players open or knock on the door, however, the room falls silent, leaving only the stillness and the cold grandeur of the room beyond.

This room is largely as described in **Dining Room** (p. 213). 
		The centerpiece of this wood-paneled dining room is a carved mahogany table surrounded by eight highbacked chairs with sculpted armrests and cushioned seats. A crystal chandelier hangs above the table, which is covered with resplendent silverware and crystalware polished to a dazzling shine. Mounted above the marble fireplace is a mahogany-framed painting of an alpine vale.
		The wall paneling is carved with elegant images of deer among the trees. Characters who search the walls for secret doors or otherwise inspect the paneling can, with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check, see twisted faces carved into the tree trunks and wolves lurking amid the carved foliage.
		Red silk drapes cover the windows, and a tapestry depicting hunting dogs and horse-mounted aristocrats chasing after a wolf hangs from an iron rod bolted to the south wall
		The silverware tarnishes, the crystal cracks, the portrait fades, and the tapestry rots if removed from the house.
When the players enter it, read:

The wall paneling is carved with elegant images of deer among the trees. Red silk drapes cover the windows, and a tapestry hangs from an iron rod bolted to the south wall.

The table groans beneath the weight of a delicious-looking feast. Exquisite dishes lay on grand platters: succulent roasted poultry glazed with a shimmering honey sauce, perfectly grilled cuts of beef still steaming lightly, a variety of cheeses and fresh fruits, and freshly baked breads giving off a comforting aroma. 

</div>

A player who partakes in the food suffers no ill effects.

##### Kitchen and Pantry

This room is largely as described in **Kitchen and Pantry** (p. 213). 
		The kitchen (area 4 A) is tidy, with dishware, cookware, and utensils neatly placed on shelves. A worktable has a cutting board and rolling pin atop it. A stone, dome shaped oven stands near the east wall, its bent iron stovepipe connecting to a hole in the ceiling. Behind the stove and to the left is a thin door leading to a well stocked pantry (area 4B). All the food in the pantry appears fresh but tastes bland.
		DUMBWAITER
		Behind a small door in the southwest corner of the kitchen is a dumbwaiter a 2-foot-wide stone shaft containing a wooden elevator box attached to a simple rope and pulley mechanism that must be operated manually. The shaft connects to areas 7A (the servants' quarters) and 12A (the master bedroom). Hanging on the wall next to the dumbwaiter is a tiny brass bell attached by wires to buttons in those other areas.
		A Small character can squeeze into the elevator box with a successful DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. The dumbwaiter's rope-and-pulley mechanism can support 200 pounds of weight before breaking.
When the players enter this room, read:

A stone, dome-shaped oven stands near the east wall, its bent iron stovepipe connecting to a hole in the ceiling. Behind the stove and to the left is a thin door.

In the front right-hand corner of the room stands a small wooden door set into the wall.

</div>

If the players inspect the cookware, they find that the largest kitchen knife is missing.

A player who enters the pantry finds that one of the shelves contains a set of beautiful decorative plates painted with pictures of windmills. One of the plates appears to have been knocked off of the shelf and lies in shattered pieces on the floor, leaving an empty spot in the row of plates.

A few inches behind the empty spot on the shelf sits an antique copper pot, its lid slightly ajar. Peaking out from beneath the lid is the cork of what appears to be a bottle of wine.

A player who opens the pot finds it to contain a bottle of wine, a folded piece of delicate lace, a vial of a brownish dried powder, and a bouquet of wilted sunflowers tied to a small scroll of parchment.

* The wine's label shows that it is from the Wizard of Wines winery and provides the name of the wine: Champagne du le Stomp. (A player that drinks the wine finds it to have turned to vinegar, as though it has magically aged centuries in mere moments.)
* The piece of lace bears the initial "K" sewn onto one corner. 
* A successful DC 14 Intelligence (Nature) check identifies the brown powder as dried silphium, a contraceptive herb. 
* The parchment scroll reads: "For the light of my life. —G."

If the players read the note, one of the knives in the kitchen flies off of its shelf and embeds itself in the opposite wall.


#### A2c. The Second Floor


##### Upper Hall

This room is largely as described in **Upper Hall** (p. 213). 
		Unlit oil lamps are mounted on the walls of this elegant hall. Hanging above the mantelpiece is a wood-framed portrait of the Durst family: Gustav and Elisabeth Durst with their two smiling children, Rose and Thorn. Cradled in the father's arms is a swaddled baby, which the mother regards with a hint of scorn.
		Standing suits of armor Aank wooden doors in the east and west walls. Each suit of armor clutches a spear and has a visored helm shaped like a wolf's head. The doors are carved with dancing youths, although close inspection and a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals that the youths aren't really dancing but fighting off swarms of bats.
		The red marble staircase that started on the first floor continues its upward spiral to area 11. A cold draft can be felt coming down the steps.

The red marble staircase continues its upward spiral to a third floor, a cold draft whispering down from above.

</div>

##### Servants’ Room

This room is largely as described in **Servants’ Room** (p. 213). 
		An undecorated bedroom (area 7A) contains a pair of beds with straw-stuffed mattresses. At the foot of each bed is an empty footlocker. Tidy servants' uniforms hang from hooks in the adjoining closet (area 7B).
		DUMBWAITER
		A dumbwaiter in the corner of the west wall has a button on the wall next to it. Pressing the button rings the tiny bell in area 4A.
When the players enter this room, read:

<div class="descriptive">

This undecorated bedroom contains a pair of beds with straw-stuffed mattresses. At the foot of each bed is a closed foot locker. A door to the left appears to lead to a closet.

In the right-hand corner stands a small wooden door, a metal button set into the wall beside it. A basket full of unwashed laundry appears to have been left beside it.

</div>

The basket contains a man's laundry, including fine suits, tunics, neckties, pants, and stockings. However, a single, much-smaller woman's slip appears to have been mixed in with the rest.

##### Conservatory

Players that approach this door can hear the faint sound of a harpsichord playing from beyond the doors. If the players open or knock on the door, however, the music falls silent.

This room is largely as described in **Conservatory** (p. 214). 
		Gossamer drapes cover the windows of this elegantly appointed hall, which has a brass-plated chandelier hanging from the ceiling. Upholstered chairs line the walls, and stained-glass wall hangings depict beautiful men, women, and children singing and playing instruments.
		A harpsichord with a bench rests in the northwest corner. Near the fireplace is a large standing harp. Alabaster figurines of well-dressed dancers adorn the mantelpiece. Close inspection of them reveals that several are carvings of well-dressed skeletons.

Several stained-glass wall hangings depict beautiful men, women, and children singing and playing instruments. A harpsichord with a bench rests in the northwest corner. Near the fireplace is a large standing harp. Alabaster figurines of well-dressed dancers adorn the mantelpiece. 

</div>

***The Harpsichord.*** A player who inspects the harpsichord finds that one of the keys appears to be permanently pressed in the "down" position. A player who investigates the interior of the harpsichord finds the cause: a rolled-up piece parchment tucked beneath one of the strings. 

The parchment is a piece of handwritten sheet music for the harpsichord titled *Waltz for Klara*. If the sheet music is played on the harpsichord, read:

<div class="descriptive">

As you press your fingers to the keys, the notes echo, a haunting melody filling the quiet, dusty room. As you continue to play, the music seems to take on a life of its own, your hands moving across the keys unbidden as if guided by an unseen force.

From the edges of the room, spectral figures begin to materialize, spinning and weaving in a ghostly dance as though led by the song. Most are unfamiliar to you, but you recognize two: Elisabeth Durst, in the corner, watching Gustav's apparition dancing with a beautiful young woman wearing humble clothes.

The eyes of Elisabeth's apparition eyes narrow into a cold, furious stare. The dancers pay her little heed, however, the song growing faster as the spirits whirl to the rhythm of the harpsichord's crescendo.

With a swift movement, Elisabeth reaches for a pendant around her spectral neck—a shimmering amber shard hung on a cord of ethereal mist. As her ghostly fist curls around it, her eyes flash a bright, menacing amber—and the spectral dancers dissipate, swept away as if by an unseen wind.

Elisabeth's apparition lingers but a moment longer before disappearing with the rest. As it does, a sound resonates through the room: the low sound of scraping wood, originating from the room across the hall. The floor trembles faintly—and you hear a crash from the mantelpiece. Two of the alabaster figurines have fallen from their place on the shelf: one, toppled over on its side; the other, shattered across the floor.

</div>

A player who inspects the fallen figurines finds that the toppled figurine has cracked across its face, arms, and torso, and depicts a young and slender female dancer. The shattered figurine has broken into dozens of pieces, and appears to have once depicted a comely, older man. A third, female dancer figurine remains defiantly standing atop the mantelpiece where all three once stood.

***The Fearful Dog.*** A player that searches this room can find a small dog hiding under an armchair. After wandering into Death House in search of food and spending three weeks locked alone inside, the dog is rail-thin, starving, and terrified of any character that approaches him. 

The dog can be coaxed out from his hiding spot, however, with a DC 10 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check, made with advantage if he is offered food. A tag on his collar identifies him as "Lancelot."<sup>1</sup>

##### Library

This room is largely as described in **Library** (p. 213-14). When the players enter this room, read:

<div class="descriptive">

Red velvet drapes cover the windows of this room. An exquisite mahogany desk and a matching high-back chair face the entrance and the fireplace, above which hangs a framed picture of a windmill perched atop a rocky crag. Situated in corners of the room are two overstuffed chairs. 

Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves line the south wall. A rolling wooden ladder allows one to more easily reach the high shelves.

</div>

***The Desk.*** A handwritten note sits atop the desk. It reads:

<div style="height:2px;"></div>

<blockquote>

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Durst,

In light of my current condition, I respectfully ask your leave for a brief time away from my responsibilities. 

While my devotion to your dear children makes this decision difficult, I have taken it upon myself to find a solution that, I hope, will serve your household well. A good acquaintance of mine is experienced in the care of children, and I believe that she could assume my role during my temporary leave without difficulty.

I realize that my request is not without its complications. However, my years serving your family have shown me the depth of your understanding and compassion. I truly feel that I have become a part of this family, and I look forward to bringing another member of that family into this world.

Yours sincerely,

Klara

</blockquote>


<div style="height:2px;"></div>

The top drawer of the desk contains a number of receipts for candles, daggers, and incense.

***The Bookshelves.*** A small rock collection sits upon one of the shelves, each of the stones labeled with its scientific name.<sup>4</sup> (This collection once belonged to Mr. Durst.) 

Immediately beside the rock collection is a book titled _The Tale of &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;_, with the final word being the name of the player character who first found it. It appears blank to any other creature, but, if read by that player character, tells the story of their life.<sup>2</sup>

The final written page of this book reads:

<blockquote style="text-align: left; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 20px;">

<em>&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; pulled the book down from the shelf and began to read, unaware of the creature that watched them from the shadows. Slowly, the beast began to creep forward.</em>

The next page is blank, save for a bloodstain. A search of the room provides no evidence of any lurking monster.

A character that searches the room and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check can see flickering candle light emanating from beneath the secret door.<sup>4</sup>

***The Secret Door.*** The secret door in this room has two components. First, a player must pull on the switch as described in **Secret Door** (p. 214). Doing so causes the bookshelf to swing forward, revealing a blank wooden wall behind it. 

Once the bookshelf has been moved, the players can see a small panel made of dark wood behind it, built into the wall at approximately chest level. A small hollow niche, jagged and irregular, lies at the panel's center and emanates a faint amber glow. 

The door cannot be opened unless the amber shard from the **Master Suite** (see below) is placed into the niche. The secret door then swings open, allowing the players to enter the **Secret Room**. The amber shard then dissipates into mist and vanishes.

##### Secret Room

This room is largely as described in **Secret Room** (p. 214). When the players enter this room, read:

<div class="descriptive">

This small hidden room is packed with bookshelves groaning with old and ominous-looking leather-bound tomes. A heavy wooden chest with clawed iron feet stands against the south wall, its lid half-closed. Sticking out of the chest, its ribs and head caught beneath the lid, is a skeleton in leather armor.

</div>

Change Strahd’s letter to read as follows:

<blockquote style="text-align: left; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 20px;">

My most pathetic servant,

I am not a messiah sent to you by the Dark Powers of this land. I have not come to lead you on a path to immortality. However many souls you have bled on your hidden altar, however many visitors you have tortured in your dungeon, know that you are not the one who brought me to this beautiful land. You are but a worm writhing in my earth.

You say that you are cursed, your fortune spent. Your husband took solace in the bosom of another woman, sired a bastard son, and drove you to abandon love for madness. Cursed by darkness? Of that I have no doubt. Save you from your wretchedness? I think not. I much prefer you as you are.

Your dread lord and master,

Strahd von Zarovich

</blockquote>

The players do not recognize the name "Strahd von Zarovich."

#### A2d. The Third Floor

As the players ascend the spiral stairs to the third floor, remind them that they can see down the center of the staircase all the way to the bottom floor.

<blockquote>

<h5> Making Multiple Ability Checks </h5>

As the players explore Death House and the many secret places within the land of Barovia, don't forget the **Multiple Ability Checks** rule, found on page 237 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*, which reads as follows:

<div class="my-quote" style="font-size: 10px;">

<p><em>Sometimes a character fails an ability check and wants to try again. In some cases, a character is free to do so; the only real cost is the time it takes. With enough attempts and enough time, a character should eventually succeed at the task. To speed things up, assume that a character spending ten times the normal amount of time needed to complete a task automatically succeeds at that task. However, no amount of repeating the check allows a character to turn an impossible task into a successful one.</em></p>

<p><em>In other cases, failing an ability check makes it impossible to make the same check to do the same thing again. For example, a rogue might try to trick a town guard into thinking the adventurers are undercover agents of the king. If the rogue loses a contest of Charisma (Deception) against the guard's Wisdom (Insight), the same lie told again won't work. The characters can come up with a different way to get past the guard or try the check again against another guard at a different gate. But you might decide that the initial failure makes those checks more difficult to pull off.</em></p>
</div>

</blockquote>

<div style="height:2px;"></div>

##### Balcony

This room is largely as described in **Balcony** (p. 214). When the players enter this room, read:

<div class="descriptive">

You climb the red marble staircase to its full height, arriving at a dusty balcony. The air here is dry and musty, but tinged with a strange, coppery scent. 

A suit of black plate armor stands against one wall, draped in cobwebs and marked by age. Oil lamps are mounted on the faded oak-paneled walls, which are carved with woodland scenes of trees, falling leaves, and tiny beasts.

</div>

When triggered, the **animated armor** will use one or both of its **_multiattack_** attacks to attempt to push a player over the railing using a ***shove*** attack, or attempt to grapple its nearest target before shoving them prone.

If the armor is thrown down to the first floor and the players do not reveal their presence atop the balcony, it is unable to observe them with its sixty feet of blindsight, and is too stupid to think to climb back up. 

A creature that is pushed over the edge of the balcony falls two stories, or twenty feet, and takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or land prone.
##### Master Suite

When a player first approaches this door, read:
<div class="descriptive">

These grand doors loom tall, their dark wood frames enclosing a pair of dusty stained-glass windows. Each pane is etched with intricate designs that resemble windmills, their once-vibrant hues now faded and obscured beneath a thick veil of grime.<br>

Through the dusty haze that prickles your eyes , you catch a glimpse of something through the windows: a silhouette, standing mere inches behind the glass. It's still and unmoving, but the mere sight of it seizes your muscles in a vice-like grip, your limbs refusing to obey your conscious mind.<br>

The air around you thickens, its temperature plummeting to a bone-chilling cold. Your breath fogs the glass panes, a delicate frost creeping across them as the house's distance creaks and whispers are swallowed by a heavy silence.<br>

The shadow behind the door is nearly formless—insubstantial—but its presence invokes a primordial dread deep within your marrow. Your heart beats faster, sweat beading on your forehead, pulse racing through your veins. Slowly, the silhouette begins to turn its head toward yours.<br>

And then, just as suddenly as it appeared, the shadow evaporates. The biting cold ebbs away, and the house's quiet sounds return once more.<br>

</div>

This room is largely as described in **Master Suite** (p. 214). When the players enter this room, read:

<div class="descriptive">

You enter a dusty, cobweb-filled master bedroom with burgundy drapes covering the windows. A four-poster bed with embroidered curtains and tattered gossamer veils stands against the center wall.<br>

A door facing the foot of the bed has a faded full-length mirror mounted on it. In the right-hand corner of the roomstands a small wooden door, its surface half-rotted by age. A tarnished metal button is set into the wall beside it.<br>

A rotting tiger-skin rug lies on the floor in front of the fireplace, which has a dust-covered portrait of the man and woman from the first-floor portrait hanging above it. A web-filled parlor in the southwest corner contains two chairs and a table holding several items, as well as a door with a dark, dirt-flecked window. <br>

The room also contains a matching pair of wardrobes, a padded chair, and a vanity with a wood-framed mirror and a silver jewelry box. A soft amber glow emanates from the jewelry box's lid.<br>

</div>

***The Bed.*** A player that approaches the bed can see that a large, bloodstained kitchen knife has been driven into one of the pillows.

***The Jewelry Box.*** The jewelry box is empty of valuables. Instead, it is filled with grain, with an *amber shard* resting in the center of the box. (This amber shard is the unique key to the secret door in the **Library**.) 

***The Balcony.*** A player that exits the bedroom onto the balcony sees that the town of Daggerford has vanished. Instead, the balcony looks out over an endless, mist-filled chasm.


##### Bathroom

This room is as described in **Bathroom** (p. 215).
		This dark room contains a wooden tub with clawed feet, a small iron stove with a kettle resting atop it, and a barrel under a spigot in the east wall. A cistern on the roof used to collect rainwater, which was borne down a pipe to the spigot; however, the plumbing no longer works.

##### Storage Room

This room is largely as described in **Storage Room** (p. 215). When the players enter it, read:

<div class="descriptive">

Dusty shelves line the walls of this room. A few of the shelves have folded sheets, blankets, and old bars of soap on them. A cobweb-covered broom leans against the far wall.

</div>

When a player first approaches within 5 feet of the **broom of animated attack**, it attacks with surprise as soon as they avert their eyes or turn away, thwacking them once upside the head. It then immediately returns to its initial position—now cobweb-free. On its future turns, the broom uses its **_multiattack_** to continue to attack any player not looking at it who remains within 5 feet, foregoing opportunity attacks against players that move away.

##### Nursemaid’s Suite


This room is largely as described in **Nursemaid’s Suite** (p. 217). When the players enter it, read:

<div class="descriptive">

Dust and cobwebs shroud this elegantly appointed bedroom. A large bed stands against the far wall, its once-opulent coverings now faded and threadbare. Beside the bed, a mildew-covered towel covers most of a dusty yellowed book on one of its two end tables. On the far side of the room, you can see a pair of two more stained-glass doors, their windows flecked with dirt and grime.<br>

To the left stands an empty wardrobe, its doors slightly ajar. Mounted beside it stands a full-length mirror, its wooden frame carved to resemble ivy and berries.<br>

To the right, an empty doorway leads into a darkened nursery. You can see the silhouette of a crib, its quiet form veiled by a hanging black shroud. A strange substance seems to cover the floor beneath it.<br>

As you look around the room, you notice that the blankets atop the bed lift slightly away from the mattress, as though something is lying atop the mattress beneath. As you watch, you can see the coverings, almost imperceptibly, slowly rise and fall with low, rhythmic rustling.<br>

</div>

***The Bed.*** A player that removes the covers from the bed finds that there is nothing beneath them. Instead, the player only finds a bloodstained mattress and crude hand-and-foot restraints made from barbed wire nailed to the four posts of the bed frame.

***The Doors.*** A player that exits the bedroom through the stained-glass doors and onto the balcony sees that the town of Daggerford has vanished. Instead, the balcony looks out over an endless, mist-filled chasm.

***The Book.*** The book is a cobwebbed copy of a raunchy romance novel titled *Blue-Blooded Lips*. It tells the story of a peasant woman's romance with a wealthy duke.

***The Nursery.*** If a player enters the nursery, read:

<div class="descriptive">

The air in this small nursery is strangely warm and tinged with a coppery scent. Blood-red runes cover the floor and walls, arranged in concentric circles around the crib in the center. Looking down, you notice that a small object seems to have fallen beneath the crib. In the distance, you can faintly hear the sound of an infant's soft whimpering.

</div>

The object is a severed human finger with several pieces of flesh stripped from it. Tiny toothmarks can be seen around the wounds. A DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check identifies the finger as a woman's, and the teethmarks as a human child's. 

The name "Walter" has been lovingly carved into the head of the crib. A successful DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana) identifies the runes around it as dark necromantic magic.

***The Mirror.*** The nursemaid’s **specter** does not appear in this room. Instead, when a player approaches the mirror, the nursemaid’s spirit appears as an apparition in the glass.

The spirit resembles a pale, skeletally thin young woman, with all of her fingers and toes removed, her eyes sewn shut, and her lips and teeth torn from her mouth. Countless knife-thin scars line her entire body, including the flesh around her wrists and ankles, and her hair has been carelessly hacked to stubble. 

Though its appearance is disturbing, players observing the spirit feel that it is simply watching them with shy curiosity.

The spirit can neither speak aloud nor exit the mirror. However, it shows no hostility toward the players, and can answer basic questions by nodding or shaking its head. It knows everything that the nursemaid did in life. It shows fear at any mention of Mrs. Durst’s name, sorrow at any mention of Mr. Durst’s, melancholic fondness at any mention of Rose or Thorn, and despair at any mention of Walter.

If the players ask the spirit for aid in reaching the basement or finding the “monster,” the spirit steps aside—vanishing from sight—and the secret door behind the mirror slowly swings open. The spirit does not return.

#### A2e. The Attic

##### Attic Hall

This room is largely as described in **Attic Hall** (p. 215). When the players enter this room, read:

<div class="descriptive">

This bare hall is choked with dust and cobwebs. Several doors lead from this attic corridor, including a door held shut with a padlock.<br>

A low creak cuts through the air as one of the unlocked doors slowly creaks open.

</div>

The door leads to the **Spare Bedroom** (see below).
##### Spare Bedroom

This room is largely as described in **Spare Bedroom** (p. 215). When the players first enter it, read:

<div class="descriptive">

This cold, dust-choked room contains a slender bed, a nightstand, a small iron stove, a writing desk with a stool, an empty wardrobe, and a rocking chair. A frowning doll in a lacy yellow dress sits in the northern window box beside a tarnished old music box, cobwebs draping it like a wedding veil.

</div>

The players can recognize the doll as the same doll that Rose was holding in the family portrait in the Main Hall.

The music box contains a rusted, bloodstained skinning knife as well as two curled-up pieces of parchment. The first parchment shows a basic floor plan split into three rectangles labeled QUARTERS, SHRINE, and ALTAR. QUARTERS and SHRINE are connected at the top by a single line, and at the bottom by a double line, which connects both to ALTAR. The second parchment contains a list of unfamiliar names beneath the word RECRUITMENT.

As the players exit the room, the rocking chair begins to rock softly and the music box opens and begins to play. The sound of motherly humming floats through the air for two measures, but grows off-key and distorted before coming to a violent, screeching halt. The rocking chair then stops rocking.

##### Children’s Room

This room is largely as described in **Children’s Room** (p. 215-16).

In life, Rose was a budding wizard who discovered a small spellbook in her father’s library, and took great care in copying the _mending_, _light_, and _shocking grasp_ cantrips into her diary.<sup>5</sup>

As the ghost children speak with the players, Thorn levitates one of his toys into the air, which falls and breaks.  Rose swiftly uses her _mending_ spell to repair it. If her use of magic is remarked upon, she shyly shares her diary’s location, which can be found hidden in the cobweb-covered pillowcase on her bed.

In addition to her cantrips, Rose’s aged and faded diary also contains entries regarding her studies, her friends, her younger brother, her nursemaid (“Miss Klara”), and arguments between her mother and father. (Rose doesn't know anything about the content of those fights.)

Rose knows the way down to the basement, but “isn’t supposed to go down there.” If the party convinces her to show them the way, she points them toward the dollhouse, revealing the secret entry. In exchange, she asks the players to take her and Thorn's bones with them when they escape, burying them in the garden outside. 

The dollhouse contains small dolls that depict tiny, twisted molds of any characters and creatures currently visible in the house. The dolls are made of painted resin. Any character looking inside the dollhouse while in Rose and Thorn’s room can see the appropriately-placed dolls of all living creatures within the manor. The dollhouse only contains rooms within the house itself, and does not depict the dungeon levels below.

##### Profile: Rosavalda "Rose" Durst
**Roleplaying Information** 
***Resonance.*** Rose should inspire sympathy for her insecurities and fears, endearment for her dedication to Thorn, and gratitude for her earnest efforts to aid the players.
***Emotions.*** Rose most often feels apprehensive, curious, defiant, or bold.
***Motivations.*** Rose wants to keep Thorn safe and comforted, and to allow their spirits to finally find peace.
***Inspirations.*** When playing Rose, channel Eleven (*Stranger Things*), Matilda (*Matilda*), and Lucy Pevensie (*The Chronicles of Narnia*). 
Character Information
***Persona.*** To the world, Rose is Thorn's fiercest protector. To those she trusts, Rose is a lost, fearful, and traumatized young girl.
***Morale.*** In a fight, Rose would plead for peace, but flee with Thorn if that proved impossible.
***Relationships.*** Rose is Thorn Durst's older sister, Walter Durst's half-sibling, and the eldest child of Elisabeth and Gustav Durst.

##### Profile: Thornboldt "Thorn" Durst
**Roleplaying Information** 
***Resonance.*** Thorn should inspire sympathy for his shyness and fear, and endearment for his childlike joy.
***Emotions.*** Thorn most often feels uncomfortable, joyous, anxious, or terrified.
***Motivations.*** Thorn wants to keep close to Rose and find toys to play with.
***Inspirations.*** When playing Thorn, channel Neville Longbottom (*Harry Potter*) and Piglet (*Winnie the Pooh*).
Character Information
***Persona.*** To the world, Thorn is a frightened young boy who clings to his sister. To those he trusts, Thorn is  a quietly observant and insightful child.
***Morale.*** In a fight, Thorn would cower and cry, pleading for Rose to rescue him.
***Relationships.*** Thorn is Rose Durst's younger brother, Walter Durst's half-sibling, and the youngest child of Elisabeth and Gustav Durst.

When the secret door is revealed, Thorn shyly asks the players if he and Rose can accompany them downstairs to aid them, and attempts to possess a friendly player if permitted. When Rose or Thorn attempts to possess a player, describe it as “a child’s tiny hand, desperately seeking the touch of another soul.” 

A player possessed by Rose can cast the cantrips in her diary, while a player possessed by Thorn can gain the effects of the _mage hand_ cantrip as an action, without the use of components. (The spectral hand is invisible.)

##### Storage Room

This room is largely as described in **Storage Room** (p. 215). When the players enter this room, read:

<div class="descriptive">

This dusty chamber is packed with lumpy, squat shapes draped in dusty white sheets. An old iron stove stands against the right-side wall, next to what looks to be a large trunk covered by a sheet.

</div>

The nursemaid’s **specter** does not appear in this room. Instead, a character who opens the trunk finds the nursemaid’s corpse, with wounds consistent with those seen on the spirit’s body in the **Nursemaid’s Suite**. A DC 14 Wisdom (Medicine) check reveals that the woman died of starvation.

A player inspecting the remains feels a cold breath on their shoulder and the unshakeable sense of being watched. Meanwhile, if another player has previously uncovered a nearby mirror from its sheet covering, that player can see an apparition of Elisabeth Durst within the mirror staring at the player near the chest. Once observed, the apparition swiftly vanishes.

**_Milestone_**. Descending into Death House's dungeon level completes a story milestone. When the party gains access to the secret stairs, award each player 200 XP. 

##### Guest Bedroom

This room is as described in **Spare Bedroom** (p. 215).
		This web-filled room contains a slender bed, a nightstand, a rocking chair, an empty wardrobe, and a small iron stove.




##### Secret Stairs

This room is largely as described in **Secret Stairs** (p. 217). When the players enter this room, read:

<div class="descriptive">

The secret door opens to reveal a narrow spiral staircase built of aged-looking wood within a tight shaft of mortared stone. Thick cobwebs fill the staircase as it descends into the darkness below.

</div>

As the players descend the stairs, read:

<div class="descriptive">

The broken cobwebs around you sway like a gossamer wedding veil, beckoning you forward as the ancient stairs creak and groan underfoot. The gaping maw of the stairwell draws you deeper, swallowing you up as you descend further down its gullet. You descend one floor—two floors—three.<br>

The walls of the stone shaft narrow around you, forcing you to hunch your shoulders and pull in your elbows to continue downward. In the darkness, you can only hear the shuffle of your feet, the choking groan of the stairs, and the pounding of your blood in your ears. <br>

Finally, after what feels like hours, the descent levels out, and the spiral staircase ends at a darkened landing of  packed earth. A narrow tunnel supported by aged timber braces stretches ahead of you, its stone walls seeming to bleed with deposits of streaked, red clay. Eight feet ahead, the tunnel splits, branching to the left and right.<br>

</div>

<div class="descriptive">



As your eyes and ears adjust to the cold, subterranean corridor, you notice that the tunnel isn't as silent as the staircase above. An eerie, low-pitched sound echoes through the space—and you soon recognize it as a deep, incessant chanting.

</div>

#### A2f. The Basement

##### Family Crypts

These rooms are largely as described in **Family Crypts** (p. 217-18). As the players approach the **Empty Crypt** and **Walter’s Crypt**, read:

<div class="descriptive">

This side-corridor branches again to the left and right. On either side, large standing stone slabs have been set aside to lean against the walls, opening the way to a pair of dark, quiet crypts. The slab to the right is etched with the name "Walter Durst"; the slab to the left is blank.

</div>

If the characters enter the **Empty Crypt**, read:

<div class="descriptive">

You peer past the leaning stone slab to see an empty earthen crypt.

</div>

If the characters enter **Walter’s Crypt**, read:

<div class="descriptive">

Swollen, bloody cysts cover the walls of this crypt like tumors. From time to time, they pulsate and burst, streams of pus oozing down to collect on the floor. In the distance, you can hear an infant's quiet whimpers.

</div>

As the players approach **Gustav’s Crypt** and **Elisabeth’s Crypt**, read:

<div class="descriptive">

This side corridor branches again to the left and right. Large standing stone slabs seal the entrance to the tunnels on either side, blocking the way forward. The slab to the left is etched with the name "Gustav Durst"; the slab to the right is etched with the name "Elisabeth Durst." The tunnel here is unnaturally quiet, and a thin mist clings to the floor.

</div>

If the characters enter **Gustav’s Crypt**, read:

<div class="descriptive">

The crypt beyond the slab contains a stone coffin lying atop a dusty stone bier. Silence hangs heavy over the lonely chamber.
</div>

If the characters enter **Elisabeth’s Crypt**, read:

<div class="descriptive">

A thick, acrid miasma hangs over the interior of this crypt, which holds a stone-carved coffin resting atop a stone bier. The floor before it is littered with the bodies of hundreds of dead termites. Many cling to the elongated, bloated body of a dead termite queen, while others appear to have died atop the scarred, mutilated bodies of four larger beetles not far away.

</div>

As the players approach **Rose’s Crypt** and **Thorn’s Crypt**, read:

<div class="descriptive">

This side-corridor branches again to the left and right. Large standing stone slabs seal the entrance to the tunnels on either side, blocking the way forward. The slab to the left is etched with the name "Rosavalda Durst"; the slab to the right is etched with the name "Thornboldt Durst." Each slab exudes the silence of a forgotten grave.

</div>

If the characters enter either crypt, read:

<div class="descriptive">

This small chamber contains a stone coffin resting on a stone bier. The air in this crypt hangs heavy with sorrow.

</div>

The players cannot help Rose or Thorn’s ghosts find peace by placing their remains in their coffins. Neither Rose nor Thorn finds these crypts comforting. Both prefer to leave as quickly as possible.

##### Cult Initiates’ Quarters

This room is largely as described in **Cult Initiates’ Quarters** (p. 218). 

As the characters move to descend to the **Well and Cultist Quarters** (p. 218), a sudden splashing sound can be heard—which then quickly subsides.

##### Well and Cultist Quarters

This room is largely as described in **Well and Cultist Quarters** (p. 218). 
		A 4-foot-diameter well shaft with a 3-foot-high stone lip descends 30 feet to a water-filled cistern. A wooden bucket hangs from a rope-and-pulley mechanism bolted to the crossbeams above the well.
		Five side rooms once served as quarters for senior cultists. Each contains a wood-framed bed with a moldy straw mattress and a wooden chest to hold personal belongings. Each chest is secured with a rusty iron padlock that can be picked with thieves' tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check.
		TREASURE
		In addition to some worthless personal effects, each chest contains one or more valuable items.
		25A. This room's chest contains 11 gp and 60 sp in a pouch made of human skin.
		25B. This room's chest contains three moss agates (worth 10 gp each) in a folded piece of black cloth.
		25C. This room's chest contains a black leather eyepatch with a carnelian (worth 50 gp) sewn into it.
		25D. This room's chest contains an ivory hairbrush with silver bristles (worth 25 gp).
		25E. This room's chest contains a book bound in grimy black leather. This journal, which one of the cultists kept as a log of the cult’s victims, contains a list of names and physical descriptions associated with each name. Each entry includes gruesome details describing the victim’s sacrifice, such as “struggled profusely” or “no sedative given.
When the players enter this room, read:


<div class="descriptive">

The ceiling of this dark, earthen chamber rises a foot higher than the cramped tunnel. It's supported by thick wooden posts and cross beams that have rotted with age and bear deep holes indicative of hungry insects.<br>

Here, a lonely well stands at the center of the room, surrounded on three sides by several smaller, alcove-like chambers that have been carved into the walls. Old footprints criss-cross the floor, leading into the alcoves, around the well, up a staircase on the other end of the room, and back upstairs the way you came.<br>

An old hempen rope attached to a rusted pulley descends past the mouth of the well, swaying gently in the stagnant air as if just abandoned by an unseen occupant.<br>

</div>


The well comprises a 4-foot-diameter well shaft with a 3-foot-high stone lip, and descends 30 feet to a water-filled cistern. A wooden bucket hangs from a rope-and-pulley mechanism bolted to the cross beams above the well. The interior of the shaft is covered with an ash-black species of fungi.

If the players toss an object down the well and then turn away, they hear loud splashing and tearing sounds coming from below. When they turn back, the object has been torn to pieces, with large parts missing.

##### Hidden Spiked Pit

This room is largely as described in **Hidden Spiked Pit** (p. 218).
	 A successful DC 1? Wisdom (Perception) check reveals an absence of footprints .. Charac;ters searching the floor for traps find a 5-foot long, 10-foot-deep pit hidden under several rotted wooden planks, all hidden under a thin layer of dirt. The pit has sharpened wooden spikes at the bottom. The first character to step on the cover falls through, landing prone and taking 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage from the fall plus 11 (2d10) piercing damage from the spikes.
If the characters enter this area from **Well and Cultist Quarters**, read:

<div class="descriptive">

The staircase leads to a quiet landing. To the front, the stairs continue upward and vanish around a bend. To the right, the landing continues straight into a lonely corridor. This tunnel hallway seems surprisingly clean and bereft of debris; at its far end, another earthen staircase descends into darkness.

The incessant chanting that has filled the air of this underground complex grows stronger toward the far end of this corridor. Its source seems to lie beyond the descending stairs.
</div>

If the characters enter this area from **Dining Hall**, read:

<div class="descriptive">

The staircase descends to a quiet landing. To the front, the stairs continue to descend, opening into a broader chamber. To the left, the landing continues straight into a lonely corridor. This tunnel hallway seems surprisingly clean and bereft of debris; at its far end, another earthen staircase descends into darkness.

The incessant chanting that has filled the air of this underground complex grows stronger toward the far end of this corridor.

If the characters enter this area from **Ghoulish Encounter**, read:

<div class="descriptive">

The staircase descends to a quiet landing. To the left, the stairs continue to descend, rounding a bend before vanishing into darkness. The incessant chanting that has filled the air of this underground complex appears to be echoing from below.

To the right, the landing continues straight into a lonely corridor. This tunnel hallway seems surprisingly clean and bereft of debris; at its far end, the corridor branches left and right.

</div>

##### Dining Hall

This room is largely as described in **Dining Hall** (p. 218). 
		This room contains a plain wooden table flanked by long benches. Moldy humanoid bones lie strewn on the dirt floor-the remains of the cult's vile banquets. In the middle of the south wall is a darkened alcove (area 28). Characters who approach within 5 feet of the alcove provoke the creature that lurks there.
When the players enter this room, read: 

<div class="descriptive">

This room contains a plain wooden table flanked by long benches. Moldy humanoid bones lie strewn on the dirt floor.  A thick stench of rot and gore fills the chamber, so coppery with blood that you can taste it on your tongue.
</div>

<div class="descriptive">

A few dozen moldy bones have been piled into a grotesque and misshapen pyramid in a dark alcove to the south.

</div>

##### Larder

This area is largely as described in **Larder** (p. 218). 
		This alcove contains a grick that slithers out to attack the first character it sees within 5 feet of it. Any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score under 12 is surprised by it. The alcove is otherwise empty.

The **grick** in this alcove—the warped remains of Gustav Durst’s flayed corpse—is coiled on the ceiling, and drops onto its victim when they enter. A DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check allows a player to determine its presence before entering. 

If the players disturb the grick, read:



<div class="descriptive">

A horrific creature—a long, flesh-like worm the breadth and length of a human man—drops from the ceiling. Its flayed muscles split open to reveal a flapping, gaping maw ringed by hundreds of tiny, humanlike teeth and a gnashing, bony beak. 

It lets out a high-pitched, gurgling squeal as it hurls itself forward, writhing, tendon-like tentacles lashing toward your face.
</div>

##### Ghoulish Encounter

This area is largely as described in **Ghoulish Encounter** (p. 218). When the players first approach this area, read: 
<div class="descriptive">
A deathly stench emanates from this corridor. The stone walls bear cracked, red stains, and a trail of old bones leads deeper down the tunnel.

</div>

<img src="https://www.gmbinder.com/images/k1PgyjB.png" style="width: 100%">

When a player first enters one of the 5-foot squares at the entrance of the corridors (marked T on the map), four **ghouls** rise up out of the ground in the spaces marked G and attack.

As the ghouls attack, they mindlessly repeat any or all of the following phrases:

* “Beautiful. We’re so beautiful.”
* “We are perfect. We are immortal.”
* “Help us live forever.”

If the players continue down the corridor, read:

<div class="descriptive">

The trail ends at the center of a quiet intersection. The incessant chanting you've heard since first entering the dungeon is noticeably louder down the northern branch of the intersection.

</div>

##### Stairs Down

This room is largely as described in **Stairs Down** (p. 218).
	It's obvious to any character standing at the top of this 20-foot-long staircase that the ghostly chants originate from somewhere below. Characters who descend the stairs and follow the hall beyond arrive in area 35
When the players approach this area, read:

<div class="descriptive">

A dark set of chiseled stone steps descends into darkness. It's clear that the origin of the muffled chanting you've been hearing lies below.
</div>

##### Darklord’s Shrine

This room is largely as described in **Darklord’s Shrine** (p. 218). 
	This room is festooned with moldy skeletons that hang from rusty shackles against the walls. A wide alcove in the south wall contains a painted wooden statue carved in the likeness of a gaunt, pale-faced man wearing a voluminous black cloak, his pale left hand resting on the head of a wolf that stands next to him. In his right hand, he holds a smoky-gray crystal orb.
	The room has exits in the west and north walls. Chanting can be heard coming from the west.
	The statue depicts Strahd, to whom the cultists made sacrifices in the vain hope that he might reveal his darkest secrets to them. If the characters touch the statue or take the crystal orb from Strahd's hand, five shadows form around the statue and attack them. The shadows (the spirits of former cultists) pursue those who flee beyond the room's confines.
	The skeletons on the wall are harmless decor.
	CONCEALED DOOR
	Characters searching the room for secret doors find a concealed door in the middle of the east wall with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. It's basically an ordinary (albeit rotted) wooden door hidden under a layer of clay. The door pulls open to reveal a stone staircase that climbs 10 feet to a landing (area 32).
	TREASURE
	The crystal orb is worth 25 gp. It can be used as an arcane focus but is not magical.
When the players enter this room, read:

<div class="descriptive">

This room is festooned with moldy skeletons that hang from rusty shackles against the walls, their mouths hanging open in silent screams. 

A wide alcove in the south wall contains a painted wooden statue carved in the likeness of a gaunt, pale-faced man wearing a voluminous black cloak, his pale left hand resting on the head of a wolf that stands beside him. The statue's right hand holds a smoky-gray crystal orb, and its painted gaze stares down toward you, a cold and cruel glint to its eye.

Five ashen shadows are burned into the walls, with soot marks stretching across the floor toward the statue.

The room has exits to the west and north. Chanting can be heard coming from the west.

</div>

A player that approaches the orb can hear many voices whispering the following phrases:

* “His gaze burns upon us.”
* “The Darklord’s eyes are always watching.”

Additionally, that player’s shadow begins to writhe and twist, its edges growing tattered and blurred as it lashes erratically across the floor. A player who touches the orb feels as though a “dark, ancient evil” has suddenly turned its eye upon them. 

If the orb is removed from its position, the ashen **shadows** upon the walls begin to stir. Each round, up to two of the shadows “awaken,” swooping across the walls. As they awaken, they murmur and moan the following phrases:

* “Begone from this place!”
* “Look not upon us.”
* “Return the Darklord’s offering!”

Once all shadows have awoken, they attack, with each shadow preferring to target a different player. If the orb is returned to its place on the statue, the shadows return to their original positions and become dormant once more.



If the players approach the door leading to **Cult Leaders’ Den**, read:

<div class="descriptive">

This old wooden door is covered in ancient red stains.

</div>

If the players have not already seen this door from the opposite side, add:

<div class="descriptive">

The half-eaten body of a rat lies at its base, its head torn off and half of the spine poking from its severed lower torso. 

</div>

Any creature that touches the door becomes adhered to it, whereupon the **mimic** attacks. The mimic also attacks if its takes any damage.

When the mimic attacks, the victim's hand is sucked inside of it. The door then deforms, sprouting dozens of mouths and eyes, with the nearest mouth attempting to bite down on the now-stuck victim.

If the **mimic** is attacked at range by a wary or alerted PC, it flees, vanishing around the corner and reappearing as a door, chest, or longsword elsewhere in the dungeon.

##### Hidden Trapdoor

This room is largely as described in **Hidden Trapdoor** (p. 219).
	The staircase ends at a landing with a 6-foot-high ceiling of close-fitting planks with a wooden trapdoor set into it. The trapdoor is bolted shut from this side and can be pushed open to reveal the den (area 3) above.
	DEVELOPMENT
	Once the trapdoor has been found and opened, it remains available to characters as a way into and out of the dungeon level.
When the players find and enter this area, read:


<div class="descriptive">

The clay staircase ends at a cramped landing. Six feet above the ground, a half-rotted ceiling of close-fitting planks holds a closed wooden trapdoor leading to an upper floor. The trapdoor is bolted shut from this side.

</div>

##### Cult Leader’s Den

This room is largely as described in **Cult Leaders’ Den** (p. 219). 
	A chandelier is suspended above a table in the middle of the room. Two high-backed chairs flank the table, which has an empty clay jug and two clay flagons atop it. Iron candlesticks stand in two corners, their candles long since melted away.
When the players enter this room, read:

<div class="descriptive">

This quiet room contains a wooden table flanked by two high-backed chairs and holding a clay jug and two flagons. Above the table is suspended an unlit cast-iron chandelier. Iron candlesticks stand in two corners of the chamber, their candles long since melted away. A short corridor at the north end of the room leads to a darkened chamber beyond.

</div>

See **Darklord’s Shrine** for more information on running the **mimic** here.


##### Cult Leader’s Quarters

This room is largely as described in **Cult Leaders’ Quarters** (p. 219). 
	This room contains a large wood-framed bed with a rotted feather mattress, a wardrobe containing several old robes, a pair of iron candlesticks, and an open crate containing thirty torches and a leather sack with fifteen candles inside it. At the foot of the bed is an unlocked wooden footlocker containing some gear and magic items (see "Treasure" below).
	Two ghasts (Gustav and Elisabeth Durst) are hidden in cavities behind the earthen walls, marked X on the map; they burst forth and attack if someone removes one or more items from the footlocker. The ghasts wear tattered black robes.
	TREASURE
	Characters searching the footlocker find a folded cloak of protection, a small wooden coffer (unlocked) containing four potions of healing, a chain shirt, a mess kit, a flask of alchemist's fire, a bullseye lantern, a set of thieves' tools, and a spellbook with a yellow leather cover containing the following wizard spells:
	1st level: disguise self, identify, mage armor, magic missile, protection from evil and good 
	2nd level: darkvision, hold person, invisibility, magic weapon
	These items were taken from adventurers who were drawn into Barovia, captured, and killed by the cult.
When the players enter this room, read:

<div class="descriptive">

This room contains a large wood-framed bed, the feather mattress rotted by years of disuse. An old wooden wardrobe carved with demonic faces stands against the wall to the left, and a faded wooden footlocker stands quietly at the foot of the bed.

</div>
<div class="descriptive">

The room is suffused with a familiar stench of death—but far stronger, mixing with a noxious scent that fills your lungs with every breath.
</div>


The wardrobe contains several old robes, a pair of iron candlesticks, and an open crate containing thirty torches and a leather sack with fifteen candles inside it. A rotting aroma also emanates from a pair of rotted organs—a half-eaten liver and a gnawed intestine—lying hidden beneath the hems of the robes.

Folded inside the foot locker, on top of its other contents, is a **boneless** (_Van Richten’s Guide to Ravenloft_, p. 228) made of the recognizable flayed skin of Gustav Durst. When the foot locker is opened, the **boneless** springs out to attack the nearest creature.

No **ghasts** attack if a player removes any items from the foot locker, and there are no hidden cavities behind the walls.

#### A2g. The Dungeon

##### Reliquary

This room is largely as described in **Reliquary** (p. 219).
	The ghostly chant emanating from area 38 fills this room. Characters can discern a dozen or so voices saying, over and over, "He is the Ancient. He is the Land."
	The cult amassed several "relics" that it used in its rituals. These worthless items are stored in thirteen niches along the walls:
	the following items are found in the niches along the wall:
	• A vial of coagulated blood
	• A lock of auburn hair, woven into a figure eight
	• A hag’s severed finger
	• A sun symbol made from woven wicker
	• A patch of dried human skin
	• A vial of murky swamp water
	• The severed claw of a raven
	• A black twig with blood-red thorns
	• A dragon’s tooth wrapped in silver wire
	• The tattered remains of a large bird feather
	• A shard of amber
	• A dried bouquet of wolf’s bane
	• The desiccated ear of an elf
	The southernmost tunnel slopes down at a 20-degree angle into murky water and ends at a rusty portcullis (area 37).
When the players enter this room, read:

<div class="descriptive">

The dusty stone steps descend past a landing and around a bend until they end at a cold, rectangular chamber. A thin, wafting mist clings to the ground, and the wooden cross beams that support the ceiling groan beneath the weight of the house and underground complex above. 

The walls of this room are cut with small, chiseled alcoves, each holding a strange, ghastly trinket or relic. A corridor with a sagging ceiling exits the chamber and bends out of sight to the right. Past it, you can see a stone slope that descends into black, murky water. The ghostly chant you've heard since entering the basement is strongest here, and seems to be emanating from the other side of a rusted, closed portcullis.

You can finally understand the words.

They say, over and over again, in a ceaseless refrain:

"He is the Ancient."

"He is the Land."

</div>

##### Prison

This room is largely as described in **Prison** (p. 219). When the players enter this room, read:

<div class="descriptive">

The sound of clinking chains melds with a quiet, near-imperceptible rustling as you round the bend into a long, darkened dungeon. Rusted shackles hang patiently from the walls, as if waiting to bite into prisoners' flesh once more.

</div>

##### Portcullis

This area is largely as described in **Portcullis** (p. 219). When the players approach this area, read:

<div class="descriptive">

The floor is submerged beneath two feet of dark, murky water that sloshes around your calves and boots. The tunnel forward is blocked by a rusty iron portcullis. Beyond its iron bars, you can make out the dark outline of a half-submerged chamber, a raised stone dais, and a thick cloud of rolling mist.

</div>

The wooden wheel that opens the portcullis is located on the eastern side of the gate (i.e., the side facing the **Reliquary**), rather than the western side (i.e., the side facing the **Ritual Chamber**). However, the chain-link mechanism has broken, preventing the players from proceeding without repairing it (e.g., by using Rose’s _mending_ cantrip) or lifting the portcullis by hand. (If the players lift the portcullis by hand and then release it, its weight causes it to shut once more unless propped open.)

##### Ritual Chamber

This room is largely as described in **Ritual Chamber** (p. 219). When the players enter this room, read:



<div class="descriptive">

The chanting stops as you peer into this forty-foot-square room. The smooth masonry walls provide excellent acoustics. Featureless stone pillars support the ceiling, and murky water covers most of the floor. Stairs lead up to dry stone ledges that hug the walls. In the middle of the room, more stairs rise to form an octagonal dais that also rises above the water. Rusty chains with shackles dangle from the ceiling directly above a stone altar mounted on the dais. The altar is carved with hideous depictions of grasping ghouls and is stained with dry blood. A small, white bundle lies atop it.

A breach in the far wall leads to a dark cave. Within that cave lies a dark, amorphous shadow, its bloated mass rising and falling with a slow, shuddering rhythm.

As soon as you step foot into the chamber, the ghostly chanting you've heard suddenly falls silent.

</div>

The bundle atop the altar is the size and shape of an infant wrapped in swaddling clothes. If unwrapped, the players instead find it to hold a rusted, serrated dagger stained red with ancient blood.

The dark shadow in the cave is a **flesh mound** containing Walter’s spirit.<sup>1</sup> It is a swollen, bloated mound of bones, flesh, and gore that seems to breathe as its mass rises and falls. A player that observes it concludes that it appears to be sleeping.

When a player first unwraps the dagger atop the altar, read the flavor text listed under **“One Must Die!”** (p. 220). The cultists’ chanting causes the **flesh mound** to begin stirring, awakening it fully after three rounds. 

The flesh mound also awakens if attacked. In either case, when the flesh mound awakens, its subsequent screeching wail causes the earth to tremble, sending the **Portcullis** crashing to the ground.

>
> ***Engulf.*** The flesh mound engulfs a Medium or smaller creature grappled by it. The engulfed target is blinded, restrained, and unable to breathe, and it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of the mound’s turns or take 8 (2d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage. If the mound moves, the engulfed target moves with it. The mound can only have one creature engulfed at a time.

If the players use the dagger to kill a humanoid creature upon the altar before the flesh mound awakens, the flesh mound returns to sleep and the cultists’ apparitions disappear. Far overhead, the players can hear the sound of the house’s front door opening, followed by the sounds of the distant thunderstorm. All monsters and apparitions vanish from the house, and the players can now leave freely.

Otherwise, the flesh mound attacks the players, fighting to the death. At the start of the flesh mound’s first turn, the cultists’ chant changes again: “The child comes! Death, be praised!”

Walter's corpse has AC 17, 20 hit points, and the same ability scores as the flesh mound. If Walter's corpse is reduced to 0 hit points, the flesh mound instantly dies.

> ***Tentacle.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (1d10 + 3) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
>
> ***Gore Spray.*** The mound spews blood and gore in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 7 (2d6) necrotic damage and is blinded until the end of the mound's next turn. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't blinded.


In combat, the flesh mound uses the above two statblocks, beginning with its first form. For one minute after it has awoken, the flesh mound’s **_heavy sleeper_** feature prevents it from using its ***multiattack*** actions in either form.

A creature engulfed by the mound’s first form can hear the faint sound of a baby crying at the center of its swollen bulk.

If both of the flesh mound’s forms are killed, its bloated body dissolves into mist, leaving a small pile of Walter’s bones behind. The cultists’ apparitions vanish immediately thereafter.

> ##### Running a Skill Challenge
> A **skill challenge** is a fast-paced action scene in which the players must use their creativity and resourcefulness to achieve a particular goal. The players don't need to make any particular checks or take any particular actions to pursue this goal—it's assumed that they're working hard off-screen to make it possible. 
>
> A skill challenge has multiple rounds, each of which can end in success or failure. On each round of a skill challenge, the party proceeds through the following steps:
>
> ***Complication.*** The DM announces a new complication obstructing the party’s efforts to reach their goal. Any player can volunteer to overcome it, thereby becoming the Active Player. (A player can't be the Active Player two rounds in a row).
>
> ***The Plan.*** The Active Player describes their plan to overcome the complication. If the DM accepts it, the Active Player’s turn begins.
>
> ***The Turn.*** As in a combat encounter, the Active Player can use an action, a bonus action, and/or an environmental interaction to assist their efforts to overcome the complication.
>
> ***The DC.*** If the Active Player’s plan is particularly creative or risky, the DM may choose to increase or decrease the complication's DC by the party's proficiency bonus.
>
> ***The Skill Check.*** The DM and Active Player agree on a single skill or tool that the Active Player will use to overcome the complication. The Active Player then makes an ability check and adds any relevant modifiers. If the DM allows it, the Active PC may gain additional bonuses based on the efforts they took during their turn:
>
> * For each cantrip, unlimited-use feature, or piece of equipment the Active Player used, they gain +2 to the roll.
>
> * If the Active Player used a low-level spell, a consumable item, or a limited-use feature, they gain advantage on the roll. (A low-level spell has a level less than the Active Player’s proficiency bonus.)
>
> * If the Active Player used a high-level spell or a feature that can be used only once per short or long rest, they automatically succeed on the roll. (A high-level spell has a level equal to or greater than the Active Player’s proficiency bonus.)
>
> On a success, the party gains one success. On a failure, the party gains one failure, and all players suffer the complication’s penalty. If the party has not yet reached the required number of successes or the maximum number of failures, the next round begins.
>
> ***The Penalty.*** If a player is reduced to 0 hit points by a complication’s penalty, they fall unconscious and cannot become the Active Player for the remainder of the skill challenge.


#### A2h. Escape From Death House

When the **flesh mound** dies, the cultists’ apparitions vanish, leaving the basement eerily silent. Far overhead, the players can hear the sound of the house’s front door opening, followed by the sounds of the distant thunderstorm.

When the players next begin to move toward the exit, read:

<div class="descriptive">

A guttural moan ripples through the air—and a terrifying apparition manifests before you: the spirit of Elisabeth Durst, her once-beautiful features now grotesquely distorted. Her lustrous hair is a wild, disheveled mess, her skin tightened and twisted into a deathly pallor, and her lips peeling back to reveal sharp, yellowed teeth. An amber shard glows ominously on a cord around her spectral neck, a shadowed wisp swirling within its depths.

The spirit levitates high above the floor, sunken eyes blazing with malice and mouth twisted into a snarl. "You may have evaded my pet," it rasps, "but I will tear this house apart before I let you escape." It throws its head back and lets loose a blood-curdling scream that reverberates across the stone walls—and sets the very foundations of the house trembling.

Far above, the grandfather clock begins to chime, the sound mounting to a thunderous cacophony. Dust and debris rain down as the floor shakes beneath you, the wooden cross beams of the ceiling starting to splinter and crack. Elisabeth's spirit fixes you with a feral grin—and then dissipates into thin air, leaving only echoes of its spiteful laugher as the house rumbles, shifts, and groans.

</div>

It soon becomes clear to the players that the entire house might collapse over their heads before they’re able to escape. As the players move to flee, a **skill challenge** begins.


The **goal** of this skill challenge is to escape Death House before it collapses. The DC for each round of the skill challenge is 14. To successfully complete the challenge, the players must accumulate five successes before three failures.

* ***Round 1.*** A sudden rockslide obstructs the path as the players ascend the stairs from the Reliquary to the Spiked Pit. _Penalty:_ Each player takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage.
* ***Round 2.*** The floor grows slick with blood and slopes downward toward the pit, which grows large, sharp teeth. _Penalty_: Each player takes 1d6 slashing damage.
* ***Round 3.*** If the players previously found the concealed door in the Darklord's Shrine (see **Concealed Door**, p. 218), they pass through it and gain two successes, proceeding to Round 7. Otherwise, they proceed north into the Dining Hall, where the gnawed bones rise into the air and attempt to skewer the players’ loose clothes—and flesh—to the walls. _Penalty_: Each player takes 1d6 piercing damage.
* ***Round 4.*** As the players ascend the Secret Stairs, a tide of blood sweeps down the staircase. _Penalty_: Each player takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage.

\pagebreakNum

* ***Round 5.*** The players emerge into the Storage Room and a cloud of noxious gas billows from the stove, filling and obscuring the room. _Penalty_: Each player takes 1d4 poison damage and is **poisoned** for the next two rounds.
* ***Round 6.*** As the players descend to the Balcony, grasping, black, blood-stained roots begin to grow from the walls and floor, attempting to entangle them. _Penalty_: Each player takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage.
* ***Round 7.*** As the players enter the Main Hall, the stuffed wolves from the Den of Wolves come to life and obstruct the path forward. _Penalty_: Each player takes 1d6 piercing damage.
 

#### B2k. Outside Death House

When the players exit Death House, the storm overhead has slowed to a mere drizzle, and the mists around the house have disappeared. Moreover, rather than night, the players emerge into a gray-lit, sunless morning. 

Most surprisingly, however, the players now find themselves in a dark forest clearing at the beginning of the **Old Svalich Road** (p. 33), rather than on the Triboar Trail. The road travels west. To the east lie dark, endless woods filled with the **Mists of Ravenloft** (p. 23).

If the players killed the **flesh mound**, the house and its adjoining buildings collapse into the earth, leaving a dark and bottomless pit behind. The pit vanishes the first time the players depart the clearing.

If the players appeased the flesh mound with a sacrifice, the house and its adjoining buildings vanish from sight the first time that no players are looking at them.

If they’re still possessing the players, Rose and Thorn’s spirits end their possessions. If asked about their new surroundings, the children remark that the woods look like their home—Barovia. They then ask the players if they can bury their remains before proceeding any further, so that they can finally rest. (The children's spirits will not proceed further into Barovia, instead pleading for the players to allow them to rest.)

If the players bury their remains here, the children’s spirits thank them before vanishing. If the players bury Walter’s remains alongside them, Death House is permanently destroyed, the spirits within put to rest. If they leave the clearing without burying Walter’s remains, however, one of the players sees Elisabeth’s spirit staring at them from the clearing. The spirit vanishes soon after.

**_Milestone_**. Escaping Death House completes a story milestone. When the party departs from Death House’s clearing, award each player 300 XP. (This should allow the players to advance to 3rd level.) If the players also buried Walter’s remains, award each player an additional 100 XP.




CoS: Visions in the mist

Vision: Madam Eva Purpose: To place a hook for the card reading and to increase Madam Eva's mystique. Added audio cue: Flicking the Trokka deck.

As you travel down the path, the mists thicken before you, forming into the shape of an elaborately carved covered wagon, bedecked in streamers and exotically formed brass fittings. As you approach the open rear door, you see an wizened old matriarch, her gnarled old fingers laying out cards upon an oaken table.
She speaks softly to herself, her voice barely audible over the sound of the cards. “Warriors come.” Flick. “More toys for Strahd.” Flick. “Wait, not just warriors.” Flick. “Adventurers.” Flick. “They could be so much more. What will become of them?” Flick. “Heh.”
She stares directly into your eyes as you gaze in silence. “You come to see me when you get here. You have much you need to know, don't you.”
The woman and her wagon dissipate into the fog as you go to touch it, the landing of her cards ringing in your ears.
Flick. Flick. Flick.

Vision: Ravens in the Mists Purpose: To plot hook for the Order of the Feather, establish ravens as a bird of warning or ill omen, and to try to keep my murder hobo from starting something with the Order. Audio cue: A lone raven cry.

As you travel down the path, the mists thicken around you, seeming to grab at you and your companions. You see a solitary tree in the distance, its leafless branches seemingly weighted down by the oppressive fog.
A lone raven perches on a low hanging branch. Its black eyes seem to bore into you, searing through all your carefully built artifices into your very being. It opens its beak and screams a warning at you that you feel in your bones.
Without warning, thousands of birds, their wings as gray as the fog, speed towards you. As they plummet directly towards your chest, their screams are drowned out by the warning cries of the lone raven. The birds pass into and through you, leaving behind a cold that you feel to your very core and vanish, leaving only the sound of the wind.

Vision: Esmeralda as warrior. Purpose: To plot hook the Vistiani, to foreshadow Esmeralda as a force, and to foreshadow that the party itself will not be automatically looked at as a force for good. No audio cue.

As you travel down the path, the mists thicken before you, forming into the shape of an intricately carved covered wagon, bedecked in streamers and exotically formed brass fittings. As you approach, you see a young woman, elaborately clothed in festive fabrics and heavily armed with a variety of specialty blades.
When you approach, the woman looks in your direction, clearly without seeing you. As she draws an filigreed ax chased with silver and a sword humming with enchantment, she speaks three words of Power, a spell you can not recognize, but clearly one to reveal evils hidden.
As she advances on you, clearly ready to strike a threat she can not see, the mists swirl upwards from the barren earth, obscuring all you perceive.
When the mists retreat, the woman and her carriage are gone, leaving behind only the sound of the wind.

Vision: Strahd, Lord of Barvoria Purpose: To establish Strahd not only as a vampire but also as a warrior and leader of warriors. Audio cue: The line "Draw near and witness, I Strahd, am the land" in the voice you're using for Strahd, after the player looks up from the handout.
This scene is lifted from P.N. Elrond's I, Strahd, with the over dramatic "box text" phrasing plastered over it.

As the mists gather ever closer, you see before you a scene played out upon a parapet of stone, overlooking a verdant mountain valley. Guards, clearly to your eyes soldiers that have seen harsh fighting and not mere liveried palace flunkies, protect a group of commanders, themselves likewise with the marks of battle upon them, who are in attendance of their lord.
The lord is a tall man, slender and pale, his dark hair pulled back, his face clean shaven. Like those he has surrounded himself with, he bears himself as a warrior, his stance and form clear indications that he did not forgo his physical training when he accepted the mantle of command. He awaits the approach of a priest standing arrogantly, even as his retinue kneel in supplication.
The holy man offers up a ceremonial blade to the lord. He accepts it as his due and holds it forth East, South, West and North. He stabs down, slicing his left arm. As the blood overflows his cupped hand onto the flagstones, he intones words of possession with a sonorous voice. “I am Ancient. I am the land.”
His eyes suddenly lock with yours and you find yourself unable to look away from them. “Draw near and witness, I Strahd, am the land.”




##### Death House Design Notes
***The Arrival.*** The illusory Rose and Thorn have been intentionally removed from this version of Death House in order to ensure that the players enter the house of their own volition and trust the real Durst children upon meeting them.

The countdown and poem have been added to provide the players with a clear sense of direction and purpose while exploring the house, and to prevent the players from taking a long rest (and therefore disrupting the balance of subsequent combat encounters) while doing so.

***The First Floor.*** The feast in the dining room has been made intentionally harmless in order to encourage the players to trust the safety of Strahd's dinner invitation when they later receive it. Additional clues have been added to convey to the players the relationships within the Durst family, including Mr. Durst's affair.

***The Second Floor.*** Clues have been added to ease the discovery of the library's secret room and to convey the depth of Mr. Durst's affair, as well as the nursemaid's pregnancy.

The dog Lancelot, a popular community character, has been retained to momentarily cut the tension and to provide the players with a sense of companionship as they pass into a strange and unfamiliar land. (To keep timelines consistent, and to allow the players to keep him without guilt, Lancelot is no longer owned by the Barovian villager [[Gertruda]].)

***The Third Floor.*** The nursemaid's specter now serves as a vital tool that allows the players to find the attic staircase without undue frustration or delay. Additional clues have been added to convey the fate of Walter, Mr. Durst, and the nursemaid.

***The Attic.*** Clues have been added to convey the nursemaid's fate and the founding of Mrs. Durst's cult.

***The Dungeon.*** Several of the encounters in this area have been changed to reduce the probability of a TPK and to teach the players to act cautiously and make wise decisions. In the ritual chamber, the cult is no longer willing to accept the sacrifice of a beast (e.g., Lancelot), foreshadowing that Strahd will not be content with Ireena alone. The **shambling mound** has been replaced by a two-stage **flesh mound**, whose statistics have been calibrated to provide a challenging fight without risking a TPK.

***Escape From Death House.*** The skill challenge escape provides a thrilling conclusion to the Death House adventure and ensures that the players will feel adequately relieved upon entering Barovia itself.

This guide has intentionally foregone a popular community addition that places a bottle of wine—courtesy of Strahd—at or near the exit of the house. Strahd is not omniscient, and the players' efforts to avoid or foil his spies will prove a recurring aspect of gameplay through the adventure. Moreover, Death House is too far from Barovia proper for Strahd to have obtained and delivered a fresh bottle of wine to its location. A villain is only as evocative as their limitations, and Strahd has many. Finally, it is an intentional design choice of this guide that the players do not encounter Strahd directly until their meeting at the River Ivlis Crossroads, which ensures that their relationship with Strahd before then is built solely on rumor, second-hand knowledge, and superstition. Earlier direct exposure would wholly spoil this effect.
