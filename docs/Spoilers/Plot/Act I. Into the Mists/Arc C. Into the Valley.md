## Arc C: Into the Valley

In this arc, the players depart the village of Barovia for Tser Pool and the town of Vallaki. As they journey through the woods, they can encounter a pair of Barovian **scouts** searching for a missing family, distract or do battle with a horde of **zombies**, and recover a weapons cache left by Dr. Rudolph van Richten.

Upon their arrival at the River Ivlis Crossroads, the players encounter Strahd von Zarovich for the first time, accompanied by Escher, one of his vampiric consorts. After a tense conversation, the players can head north to Tser Pool. 

On the way to Tser Pool, the players encounter a raven—the disguised **wereraven** Muriel Vinshaw—fleeing a monstrous **strix**, a scarecrow of the skies crafted by the swamp-witch Baba Lysaga. If the players defend Muriel from the strix’s onslaught, she joins them for the remainder of their journey to Vallaki, though without revealing her true identity.

Soon afterward, the players finally arrive at the Vistani encampment at Tser Pool. There, they receive a magical Tarokka reading from Madam Eva, which foretells the location of three artifacts that will assist them in the fight against Strahd, as well as an ally who is destined to aid them. 

While staying at Tser Pool, the players hear Vistani tales of Strahd's history and the *Holy Symbol of Ravenkind*, and can also meet Arturi Radanavich, a wandering Vistana who claims to have once known Rudolph van Richten. As the players depart, they also receive a mission from Madam Eva to purchase a toy in Vallaki for delivery to her great-grand-niece, Arabelle.

If the players are tasked with escorting Ireena to St. Andral's Church in Vallaki, or if they have their own reasons for doing so, they then return to the Old Svalich Road via the River Ivlis Crossroads, traveling west through the mountains. Along the way, they encounter a strange skeletal rider, a pair of fresh graves, a watchful revenant, the **night hag** Morgantha in her peddler's disguise, two flocks of friendly **ravens**, and a werewolf accompanied by its pack of ravenous **wolves**. 

Upon arriving in Vallaki, the players can find lodgings at the Blue Water Inn. There, they can meet a host of colorful characters, including the sons of Lady Fiona Wachter and the ringmaster Rictavio. When morning comes, the players can also have a fateful encounter with Baron Vargas Vallakovich and his brutish enforcer, [[Izek Strazni]]...

> ##### The Road From Tser Pool
>
> The module’s map of Barovia depicts a dotted line that appears to connect the Tser Pool Encampment to Tser Falls. Despite its appearance, <strong>Tser Falls</strong> (p. 37) makes clear that this is not a shortcut. Instead, this dotted line is a footpath that leads to the base of Tser Falls, one thousand feet below the bridge overhead. At no point does it actually reconnect to the main road. 
>
> To travel from the Tser Pool Encampment to Vallaki, the players will instead need to travel south, back toward the River Ivlis Crossroads, then take the Old Svalich Road westward.

### C1. The Svalich Woods

The journey from the village of Barovia to the River Ivlis Crossroads is three miles long and takes one hour. 

#### C1a. The Barovian Scouts

As the players travel, read:

<div class="descriptive">

You set off from the silent village of Barovia, the fog creeping around your feet as you pass onto the Old Svalich Road. A sea of tall, pale-green grasses stretches out before you on either side of the road, all the way up to the edge of the Ivlis River. The sky above is a dull grey, the clouds heavy with the promise of rain.

It's not long before you can see the old arched stone bridge in the distance that spans the clear blue river ahead. Crossing it, you find yourselves on a muddy road that winds its way through the trees. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, and the trees press in close, casting deep shadows that carve dark gouges across the road.

</div>

If any players have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 16 or higher, they hear a rustling noise and see a silhouette crouching in the misty underbrush. Otherwise, the players simply hear a voice call out, muffled and diffuse in the fog: “Who goes there? Name yourselves.”

\columnbreak

The voice belongs to a gruff female Barovian **scout** named Kereza, who is joined by a second, soft-spoken male **scout** named Tural. The two warily demand to know if the players are spies or servants of Strahd. If reassured, the scouts warn the players that Strahd’s spies are numerous throughout the Svalich Woods, including wolves, bats, and—at times—the very trees themselves. (If asked about the trees, the scouts can describe seeing animate vines, saplings, and bramble-patches that wander through the woods with hostile intent.)

If Ireena is with the players, she can aid the players in reassuring the scouts, who recognize her and greet her with quiet respect. The scouts are surprised to see Ireena venturing forth from the village, but agree that Vallaki is likely a safer place than Barovia—assuming, of course, that she can make it there safely. (Ireena stubbornly insists, however, that her journey is a diplomatic and humanitarian one, and that the players are her escorts and bodyguards.)

The scouts are searching for the Lansten family: two parents and three young children—a girl and two boys—who went missing during the zombie attack on the village and haven’t been seen since. After asking whether the players have seen their quarries on their journey, the scouts warn them not to stray from the road, noting that dead and dark things lurk beneath the treetops. Kereza and Tural then respectfully depart.

Shortly after the players resume their trek down the Old Svalich Road, a light drizzle begins to fall, stirring a fine mist that drifts through the underbrush.

#### C1b. Van Richten’s Cache

As the players continue down the road, read:

<div class="descriptive">

You travel further into the woods, the muddy road guiding you deeper and further away from civilization. As the road bends, the river brushes up against you once more. Here, the river is wider, its waters dark, and still. You can see the reflection of the trees and fog in its surface. The sound of the quiet, trickling water is met only by the rustling of leaves and the drizzle of soft rain. No birdsong breaks the silence that hangs over the woods.

</div>

If the players received the location of Van Richten’s hidden weapons cache from Doru in Barovia’s church, they can enter the woods to the south to find it. If they do, read:

<div class="descriptive">

You step from the road and into the woods, crossing the treeline as your feet squelch into mud and loamy soil. Wisps of fog curl across the earth around you, gnarled trees reaching their arms overhead as gray light filters through the canopy. You walk for three hundred paces, stepping softly through the mulch and mist until you arrive at a clearing, the woods parting to make room for a tall, ancient oak whose knotted black trunk rises far above its peers.

You soon realize, however, that you’re not alone. Five figures shamble or stand aimlessly within the clearing, their clothes muddied and torn and their flesh just beginning to turn pallid and gray. A sixth figure, bearing the remnants of tattered leather armor, stands just beside the tree, its white eyes staring dully into the canopy overhead. This figure’s flesh, though rotting, is a smooth, sickly white, its skin run through with raised, crimson veins. A faint cloud of reddish mist spills from its mouth and down onto the forest floor around it before dissipating into the air.

</div>

The five figures are **zombies**. They also match the descriptions of the Lansten family provided by the scouts—two parents, a young girl, and two young boys. The sixth figure is a **zombie plague spreader** (*Van Richten’s Guide to Ravenloft*, p. 255) created by Strahd, and the former leader of the undead siege.

The players can attempt to lure the zombies away from the clearing; given the zombies’ low intelligence, doing so should be reasonably easy. Alternatively, the players can attempt to ambush and attack the zombies to destroy them altogether.

If the players reach the oak tree, they can find Van Richten’s weapons cache where Doru told them: in a hollow nestled beneath the tree’s roots. The cache itself is a small, unlocked wooden chest containing 20 silvered crossbow bolts, a light crossbow, two **healer’s kits**, two vials of *holy water*, and one *potion of healing.*

\columnbreak


### C2. River Ivlis Crossroads

As the players approach this area, the drizzling rain stops. Read:

<div class="descriptive">

Soon, the river bends once more out of sight and the dark woods surround the road once again. Finally, though, the trees pull away, revealing a tall cliff at the base of a foggy mountain slope. The air is cold and damp here, and soft wisps of fog swirl around the base of the cliff.

</div>

The players have arrived at the River Ivlis Crossroads, which is largely as described in **River Ivlis Crossroads** (p. 35). Do not check for a random encounter when the players arrive.

This scene begins similarly to **River Ivlis Crossroads** (p. 35). However, the first time the players move to depart for Tser Pool, instead of seeing **The Hanged One**, they can hear the sound of a horse-drawn carriage or wagon approaching through the fog. Almost as soon as the sound appears, Strahd’s black carriage, as described in **Black Carriage** (p. 37) and **Carriage House** (p. 54) comes into view.

#### C2a. Strahd’s Arrival

The players can see a driver sitting in the coach box: the **vampire spawn** Escher, as described in **K49. Lounge** (p. 70). An ugly red scar now runs across Escher’s right cheek. (The scar was left by Dr. Rudolph van Richten in a recent skirmish. See ***Arc E: The Missing Vistana*** for more information.) If present, Ireena gasps at the sight of him, whispering his name, insisting that she thought that he was dead, and wondering aloud at the source of his scar.

<div style="height:2px;">&nbsp;</div>

<blockquote>

<h5>What If The Players Flee?</h5>

The players should have little time to attempt to conceal themselves before Strahd’s carriage comes into view. However, if the players attempt to flee the carriage into the woods, Strahd’s six **dire wolves** emerge from the fog behind them and snarl, obstructing their escape.

</blockquote>

<div style="height:2px;">&nbsp;</div>

The carriage then comes to a stop. Read the following, modifying the text as necessary if Ireena isn’t present, and pausing briefly after each paragraph to allow the players a short opportunity to act or react:

<div class="descriptive">

The driver releases the reins, steps down from the coach box, and moves to open the side door of the carriage, bowing deeply. A moment passes—and then a man steps out from the carriage.

He is tall, gaunt, and dressed in finery befitting a man of aristocratic, even royal stature. A black cloak is pulled neatly around his shoulders, tied at the neck by a blood-red brooch. A longsword rests ensheathed at his hip, its polished hilt gleaming beneath the dim light. His scarlet tunic is worked with intricate designs, and his hair is pulled back into a sharp and immaculate widow's peak. 

</div>

\pagebreakNum

<div class="descriptive">


His eyes are dark, and as he moves to adjust the ruby at his neck, you see that his fingernails form long, elegant claws. It's only then that you realize that his skin is pale—unnaturally so— and that his eyes glint with a deep, intelligent hunger.

</div>

If Ireena is with the party, add:

<div class="descriptive">

Ireena rocks backward, as if slapped. She averts her eyes from the man's gaze, her entire body tightening. "Don't look into his eyes," she chokes out.

The man's gaze rests briefly on Ireena, and he smiles—though no warmth reaches his eyes. "Lady Kolyana," he says. "What a pleasant surprise." He then turns his gaze to you. 

</div>

Whether Ireena is with the party or not, add:

<div class="descriptive">

"Good day," he says. "I am Count Strahd von Zarovich—and it is a pleasure to finally meet the newcomers to my domain. My friends have told me so much about you." His eyes linger over each one of you in turn, regarding you like a cut of meat weighed at market, a prey animal spotted by a predator in the bush—an intriguing but inanimate trinket.

</div>

#### C2b. The Conversation Begins

If undiverted, Strahd greets each of the player characters individually—by name, if his spies have had a chance to learn them and report back to him. While doing so, he makes a personal comment regarding each character’s species, class (if apparent from their equipment or dress), and/or personality (if reported by his spies). If possible, he frames each comment in the form of a compliment, sympathetic remark, or (sparingly) exceptionally veiled threat.

If Ireena is present, Strahd then asks if “Lady Kolyana” has properly introduced them to his domain, and apologizes for any “folktales” his subjects may have shared about him. 

(He does not, however, deny his attack on the village of Barovia, noting only that the people of the village defied him in an act of utmost treason. "I am sure that you can agree that my response was a measured one," he says. "After all, no lord could tolerate a settlement that fostered such sedition. The good people of Barovia needed to be taught a lesson. Their discipline was a kindness that few others would entertain.")

As the conversation progresses, Strahd notes that he's heard "such wonderful things" of the players' exploits at "a certain old house at the edge of my domain." Strahd then makes brief reference to the players' actions in Death House, sardonically lauding:

* their "heroic and compassionate spirits" if they put Walter's spirit to rest;
* their "fierce and fiery valor" if they defeated the flesh mound; and/or
* their "cunning and ruthless will" if they made a sacrifice on the cult's altar.


<blockquote>

<h5>Strahd’s Foretelling</h5>

At the time that he encounters the players, Strahd is returning from a visit to Madam Eva’s tent at the Tser Pool Encampment. Finding the Forest Fane’s power difficult to control due to Baba Zelenna’s interference during his slumber, he sought Madam Eva’s counsel in his preparations for the Grand Conjunction. He received the following fortune:

<div class="my-quote" style="font-size: 10px;">

<p>"The Darklord—the master of shadows, the beast in the labyrinth that tears at his chains.</p>

<p>"The Six of Stars, the Evoker—the power you covet, a force untamed by mortal hands, raw and wild with burning fury.</p>

<p>"The Artifact—the token you seek, the key to power. Divinity’s heart waits, but where?</p>

<p>"The Innocent. I see a maid of raven hair and twilit eyes. She is one way to the token.</p>

<p>"But there is another—the Broken One. The path of sacrifice opens another door. The wall that whispers awaits your tribute.</p>

<p>"The threads of fate yet spin. The Seven of Swords, the Hooded One, is next. Strangers walk the land—their presence a riddle, their intentions a maze. They dwell in the dusk, their role yet unclear.</p>

<p>"But the One of Stars, the Transmuter, is last. Change comes on newcomers’ wings, the twilight of an era upon us. As one age ends, another is born."</p>

</div>

<div style="height:10px;"></div>

Much of Strahd’s foretelling was overheard by Muriel Vinshaw, an eavesdropping <strong>wereraven</strong>, until Strahd detected her presence and drove her away. Both Muriel and Strahd were unaware that Madam Eva knew of Muriel’s presence all along. As the hidden avatar of the Seeker, Eva bears a special bond with Barovia’s wereravens, and deliberately continued her foretelling to allow Muriel to hear it.

Muriel heard the first five cards that Madam Eva read, but doesn’t know the last two. More information about Muriel and her escape from Strahd’s minions can be found in <em><strong>C3. The Strix</strong></em> below.

</blockquote>


(If the players ask about the nature of Death House, or its purpose in bringing them to Barovia, Strahd smiles coldly and says only, "The souls of the damned are tragically twisted things. Do not linger upon their madness.")



If the players ask about Strahd's driver, Strahd introduces him as Escher, "my coachman and cupbearer." Escher does not respond to the players’ questions or statements and simply stands demurely at Strahd’s side.

#### C2c. Strahd's Questions

During the conversation, at moments when it seems natural to do so, Strahd poses the players the following questions (in no particular order):


\pagebreakNum

* "Ismark Kolyanovich defied me by keeping his sister from me. Why should I, as his lord, not punish him for his disloyalty?"
* "I have claimed Ireena Kolyana, and twice marked her as my own. Why should I not take her with me to Castle Ravenloft right now?"
* "You are trespassers in my lands, and the last outsider that entered Barovia fostered sedition and treachery. Why should I not dispatch with you now, in the same way that I dispatched with him?" (Strahd's question is referring to Dr. Rudolph van Richten.)

If the players buried Walter's bones and put the spirits of Death House to rest, Strahd poses an additional question:

* "Immediately prior to your entry to my lands, you caused great damage to a group of my servants—the occupants of a particular house on the borders of my domain. I had relied upon those servants to bring me specimens of interest, but your activities have left them indefinitely indisposed. Why should I not punish you for your crimes against them?"

Strahd frames each of these questions as a hypothetical. In asking them, his tone is inquisitive, curious, and at least somewhat amused. If the players despair at the prospect of answering these questions at all, Strahd notes, "I am not an unreasonable man. If there is some reason or rationale that I might have missed, then by all means do enlighten me."

#### C2d. Strahd's Concessions

As the players attempt to answer his questions, Strahd delights in playing Devil's advocate, pushing back against their responses and probing at the holes in their reasoning. Ultimately, though, if the players' points are at least reasonably well-argued, Strahd is willing to accept them. (It should be fairly clear to the players, however, that he is merely humoring them by accepting their responses.)

The players can push Strahd to make the following concessions:

* He agrees to overlook Ismark's transgressions, so long as Ismark does not defy him or act counter to his will again.
* He agrees to allow Ireena to depart the River Ivlis Crossroads safely. (Strahd will not grant a longer grace period than that.) 
* He agrees to refrain from judgment against the players unless they take action directly against his person.
* He agrees to forgive the players their transgressions against the cult of Death House.

The players might successfully exact these concessions using a variety of arguments, including (but not limited to) the following:

* The players have promised Ismark that they will escort Ireena to Vallaki and they must be allowed to fulfill their word.
* The players have taken no hostile action against Strahd and should be granted a presumption of innocence.
* The players' actions in Death House were conducted in self-defense, and therefore should be excused. 

\columnbreak

<blockquote>

<h5>The Players Misbehave</h5>

If any of the players act rudely toward Strahd, he doesn't feel a need to "punish" or "discipline" them. Instead, he responds with amusement, like a parent soothing a child throwing a tantrum. Strahd doesn't view the players as a threat to either his ego, his person, or his reputation, and treats them accordingly.

In such a situation, Strahd might draw upon the following lines of dialogue when responding to a misbehaving player:<sup><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/e99hko/an_anthology_of_strahds_taunts_and_quips/">1</a></sup>

* "Do not imagine that you are the first to invade my realm."
* "If you are trying to impress me, you have failed."
* "What lies do you tell yourself before you close your eyes at night?"
* "There is none in all of Barovia whose honor you have more cause to trust."
* "Faith is that faculty which enables us to believe things which we know to be untrue."

If, at any point during the encounter, the players move to threaten Strahd or flee, read: 

<div class="my-quote" style="font-size: 10px;">

<em>From behind Strahd, you hear a chorus of low, feral growls. Multiple pairs of eyes glint from the underbrush—each one the height of a man's shoulder.</em>

<em>Slowly, from the shadows, slinks a pack of massive wolves, each one as tall as a horse and twice as muscled, measuring nine feet in length from head to haunches. Their fur is a thick, mottled grey, and saliva drips from their yellowed, sharpened teeth. </em>

<em>They take up positions behind and around Strahd, flanking him like a noble's honor guard.</em>

<em>"You must forgive my pets," Strahd says. "They can be...*overenthusiastic* at the sight of new friends."</em>

</div>

<div style="height:10px;"></div>

The wolves are **dire wolves**, as described in **Dire Wolves** (p. 30). (The number of dire wolves in the pack is equal to the number of players in the party.)

If the players appear to need further persuading, the dire wolves step forward, growling with their hackles raised. If the players proceed to attack Strahd or flee, the wolves attack.

</blockquote>

If the players appear to doubt Strahd's fidelity to his concessions, he promises, "Fear not, dear children. I am no liar. We both know deception is for the weak."<sup><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/e99hko/an_anthology_of_strahds_taunts_and_quips/">1</a></sup>

When the players have answered all of Strahd's questions to his satisfaction, he bids them farewell and steps back into the black carriage.

As he does, Strahd’s six **dire wolves** emerge from the woods, if they haven’t already, and move to flank the carriage. Strahd notes that he and his “friends” shall see the players again—perhaps very soon. The carriage then departs for Castle Ravenloft.

\pagebreakNum

#### C2e. Departing the Crossroads

As the players move to depart the River Ivlis Crossroads after Strahd has left, they encounter **The Hanged One** (p. 35). (The character hanged from the gallows should be the character who was the rudest to Strahd or the least cooperative with his questions.)


### C3. The Strix

Halfway down the path from the River Ivlis Crossroads to Tser Pool Encampment, the players hear the sound of a distressed bird cawing from above. A raven with blue-tipped wings—recognizably the same raven that met them in the village of Barovia—then crashes into the road at the players’ feet, visibly wounded. This is, again, the **wereraven** Muriel, in disguise with 1 hit point. Her wings and torso have been penetrated by several dozen silver barbs, leaving her unable to fly, regenerate, or transform until removed.

The raven’s arrival is followed soon after by a terrible, grating shriek and the arrival of a **greater strix** (using the statistics of a **manticore**): an enormous artificial “bird” crafted of wood, animal skins, burlap, and hundreds of black raven’s feathers. (Instead of actual tail spikes, the greater strix’s **_tail spikes_** attack releases a volley of dozens of tiny silver barbs from its wings.)

The greater strix is joined by two **swarms of lesser strix** (each using the statistics of a **swarm of ravens**). Each lesser strix is an artificial “crow” slightly larger than a raven, crafted of burlap, straw, twigs, and sharp stone teeth.

These abominations was built by the witch Baba Lysaga to hunt down wereravens. These particular strix—a gift from Baba Lysaga to Strahd upon his awakening—have been ordered to hunt and kill Muriel, who was spotted eavesdropping on the Tarokka reading that Strahd received from Madam Eva earlier that morning. It continues to pursue Muriel, attacking the players if they obstruct it. It fights to the death.

If rescued, Muriel remains with the players until she can discern their intent. A player can remove the silver barbs in her body and wings with a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check, reducing her to 0 hit points and causing her to fall unconscious on a failure. Once the barbs are removed, however, Muriel’s regeneration immediately returns, healing her wounds in a matter of seconds.

If she learns that they plan to travel to Vallaki, she travels with them while maintaining her raven disguise, hoping to rely upon safety in numbers until she can report her findings to Urwin Martikov at the Blue Water Inn. Under no conditions does Muriel willingly reveal her true nature to the players.

### C4. Tser Pool

The journey from the River Ivlis Crossroads to the Tser Pool Encampment is one-and-a-half miles long and takes thirty minutes.

#### C4a. Arrival at Tser Pool

This area is largely as described in **G. Tser Pool Encampment** (p. 36). However, none of the Vistani at the camp are intoxicated, and only one—a Vistana woman named Eliza—serves as a spy for Strahd.

<blockquote>

<h5>Lycanthropy in Barovia</h5>

In Barovia, the curse of lycanthropy spreads as described in **Player Characters as Lycanthropes** (*Monster Manual*, p. 207). However, an infected player or other creature does not automatically receive any changes to their ability scores or Armor Class, nor do they automatically receive the benefits of the lycanthrope's stat block (e.g., immunities or regeneration).

Instead, an infected creature only receives the benefits of lycanthropy upon transforming into their hybrid form on the night of the full moon. During this time, the creature becomes an NPC under the DM's control until dawn, at which point the creature loses the benefits of lycanthropy.

An infected creature can embrace the curse of lycanthropy—and so gain its full benefits—by completing a certain task, depending on the nature of their curse:

* An infected **werewolf** must voluntarily kill another humanoid and devour their flesh.

* An infected **wereraven** must be knocked unconscious while voluntarily attempting to protect another humanoid from (what they believe to be) near-certain death.

An infected lycanthrope can be recognized by the scar of the wound that originally transmitted the curse. The wound will never entirely heal, and remains raw and bloody until the curse is lifted.

A creature born from two lycanthrope parents possesses the full benefits of lycanthropy from birth, and may learn to control their curse as they age.

Finally, while the mists remain, the lunar cycle is accelerated in Barovia: the full moon arrives once every two weeks, instead of once every four. **The first full moon that the players experience takes place on the third night after they first arrive in Vallaki.**

<div style="height:2px;"></div>

<h5>Lycanthrope Regeneration</h5>

Lycanthropes in Barovia—including both **werewolves** and **wereravens**—don’t have immunity or resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage made with nonsilvered weapons. Instead, all lycanthropes who have either transformed or embraced their curse gain the following feature:

* ***Regeneration.*** The lycanthrope regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the lycanthrope takes necrotic damage or damage from a silvered weapon, this trait doesn’t function at the start of the lycanthrope’s next turn. The lycanthrope dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn’t regenerate.

Accordingly, **lycanthropes generally cannot be killed without the use of silver or necrotic damage.** Even other magic—excepting certain spells that destroy the bodies of their victims, such as *disintegrate*—is not enough to permanently defeat them.

As the players enter the camp, they are met by Stanimir, an old Vistana who informs them that the leader of their encampment, Madam Eva, has been waiting for them and points them toward Eva’s tent. Stanimir, a jovial, colorful old man with a twinkle in his eye is largely as described in **Mysterious Visitors** (p. 19). However, he has the spell *major image* prepared rather than *vampiric touch*.

Stanimir is happy to answer any questions that the players may have about the Vistani or about Barovia, as described in **Vistani Lore** (p. 27). However, he will not discuss Strahd’s business at Tser Pool. Instead, he shares his belief that Strahd will not soon return, and reassures the players that anything discussed at their meeting with Madam Eva will not reach the vampire’s ears. 

If the players ask whether Strahd obtained a foretelling from Madam Eva, Stanimir tells them that Madam Eva shares her gifts freely with all—but that each person’s future is different, and often difficult to discern.

#### C4b. The Tarokka Reading

This scene unfolds largely as described in **Madam Eva’s Tent** (p. 37). After greeting the players, Madam Eva names each player character personally, giving them one or more symbolic epithets related to their histories, their goals, and/or their capabilities.

She thanks the players for making the journey to Tser Pool. If asked about Strahd’s visit, she says only that each person’s future is their own to know, and that, while her duty binds her to seek the whispers of Fate for any who invoke her name, she is bound not to reveal what she sees to anyone else.

If Muriel is with the players in raven form, Madam Eva regards her with an emotion nearly resembling fondness and asks to inspect her. She strokes Muriel’s wings and notes that she once had a beloved pet raven named Turul many years ago.  “I have not seen him for many years, however,” Eva adds, somewhat mournfully.

<blockquote>

<h5>Profile: Madam Eva</h5>


**Roleplaying Information**

***Resonance.*** Madam Eva should inspire discomfort with her intimate knowledge of the players’ pasts, gratitude for her dedication to the players’ journey, and reassurance with her confident predictions.

***Emotions.*** Madam Eva's most frequent emotions are amusement, solemnity, concern, and contemplation.

***Motivations.*** Madam Eva wants to see the land of Barovia healed and freed from Strahd's corruption.

***Inspirations.*** When playing Madam Eva, channel The Ancient One (*Doctor Strange*) and the Fates (*Hercules*).

<div style="height: 1px;"></div>

**Character Information**

***Persona.*** To the world, Madam Eva appears as a wise, yet maddened crone who speaks in prophecies and riddles. To those she trusts, she appears as a kind, yet frustratingly opaque and stubborn old woman. 

***Morale.*** In a fight, Madam Eva would calmly insist that her opponent cease their attacks, then—if her Vistani aides prove unable to stop her assailant—weaken them with the *harm* spell before demanding their surrender.
 
***Relationships.*** Madam Eva alone knows that she is an avatar of the Seeker.

</blockquote>

 “Doubtless, he has gone wild without me.” (Madam Eva is referring to the **Roc of Mount Ghakis**, which served her when she retained the mantle of the Seeker of the Ladies Three.)


Madam Eva then asks the players if they would like their fortunes read, and produces a worn deck of cards if so. She then pauses and closes her eyes, though they flash wide open again soon after. Read:

<div class="descriptive">

Madam Eva’s voice is a low hiss as she speaks, her silhouette dancing in the flickering candlelight. "A shadow is approaching my tent: a lone servant of Darkness. They seek knowledge of your future—secrets that I am sworn never to reveal to any but their keepers. 

“Do not look, child, nor rush to greet them; if they learn the import of what we have discussed, all may be lost. Do not reveal, even, that you know of their true nature, for their master will know that I have told you, and his wrath will descend upon us all. I will read the cards as swiftly as I dare before they arrive, and you will listen closely, for I shall never again repeat what they say. Are you ready?"

</div>

If the players respond affirmatively, read the following text, choosing the appropriate descriptions and narration where appropriate:


<div class="descriptive">

Her old hands working deftly, the ancient seer removes fourteen cards from the top of the deck, setting them aside. The remaining cards, she shuffles nimbly twice, three times, four.

Madam Eva sets both decks upon the surface of the velvet table. Closing her eyes, she places her right hand over the surface of the larger deck. The crimson flames dim and swirl in eldritch patterns as her lips move silently, a distant tension spreading through the air. The sounds of the rustling trees and rippling pool beyond the tent's walls begin to dim, the external world growing mute and insubstantial as the space within grows more solid—more real.

Slowly, reverently, the crone draws three cards from the top of the deck, laying them face down separately on the table, with the second laid between and above its partners. She then moves to the smaller deck, drawing two more cards. The first, she places below the first three, forming a cross. The second, she places in the center.

The lights of the candles sway like silhouettes, leaning in toward the cards like anxious watchers—yet the air in the tent is perfectly still. No light intrudes through the seams in the tent's walls; no voice rings out in the silence. Shadows and mist swirl at the boundaries of the tent, where the darkness of deepest night dwells—but here, at its center, light yet reigns.

<h5>The Tome of Strahd</h5>

The crone then moves her wrinkled hand to the left-most card—the first. She closes her eyes and tilts her head, as if listening to an unspoken word. The arcane lights swirl and then shift, their colors changing to a deep, piercing blue.

"This card tells of history. Knowledge of the ancient will help you better understand your enemy."

She flips the card.

The cerulean light dances across its surface, revealing an illustration of:

<div style="height:4px;"></div>

* ***Nine of Swords—Torturer.*** A scowling, bearded man, clad in leather armor and a hood tipped with spikes, his calloused, gnarled hands turning the wheel of a grisly device. “The Nine of Swords—the Torturer.” Her dark pupils shift from side to side, as though reading from an unseen text. **There is a town where all is not well. There you will find a house of corruption, and within, a dark room full of still ghosts.**


<h5>The Holy Symbol of Ravnekind</h5>

She moves her hand to the second card, this one at the top of the cross. As she closes her eyes and listens once more, the candlelight flares, its color bursting into a fierce, cheery yellow.

"This card tells of a powerful force for good and protection, a holy symbol of great hope."

She flips the card.

This time, the light reveals a new illustration: an armored warrior clutching a cracked iron sword and a leather-bound wooden shield, his face obscured by a heavy iron helmet. “The Five of Swords—the Myrmidon.” Her eyes stare deep into the shadows that lurk in the corners of the tent. **Look for a den of wolves in the hills overlooking a mountain lake. The treasure belongs to Mother Night.**

<h5>The Sunsword</h5>

She moves her hand to the third card, at the right arm of the cross, her eyelids closing like a trance, her lips pursed in quiet contemplation. The candlelight vanishes, for a heartbeat—and then returns in a nova of fierce, burning white, so pure and strong and clean that it hurts to look at, burns to see—

Madam Eva's eyes snap open, burning with a fierce determination.

"This is a card of power and strength. It tells of a weapon of vengeance: a sword of sunlight."

She flips the card.

The light reveals a third illustration: a solemn-faced man clad in holy vestments, one hand clutching the chain of a bronze censer that billows with burning smoke. “The Eight of Glyphs—the Bishop.” The crone's voice is strong with purpose. **What you seek lies in a pile of treasure, beyond a set of amber doors.**

</div>

<div class="descriptive">

<h5>Strahd’s Enemy</h5>

She moves to the fourth card, at the bottom of the cross, and listens once more, tracing small circles across its back as she hums a contemplative note. The magic flames leap and dance upon their wicks, now casting swirling violet embers into the air as the walls of the tent gleam with the shimmer of twilight.

"This card sheds light on one who will help you greatly in the battle against darkness."

She flips the card.

This time, the illustration revealed is a quiet graveyard choked with fog, its entrance sealed with a sharp iron fence. "The Mists." Madam Eva leans forward. **A Vistana wanders this land alone, searching for her mentor. She does not stay in one place for long. Seek her out at Saint Markovia's abbey, near the mists.**

<h5>Strahd’s Location</h5>

Finally, she moves her hand to the fifth card—and nearly recoils, her brow furrowing until the wrinkles split her forehead like a trench. Behind her, shadows encircle the candlelight until the light is very nearly swallowed by the creeping dark. When next she speaks, Madam Eva's rasping voice is scarce above a whisper.

"Your enemy is a creature of darkness, whose powers are beyond mortality. When the hour of judgment arrives, this card will lead you to him!"

Her hand trembles above the card for a silent moment—and then deft, ancient fingers reveal its opposite side.

In the darkness, the fifth and final illustration is only barely visible through the smoke and unnatural murk. Upon the card's surface dwells a depiction of a crowned, grinning emperor clad in royal finery and reaching for a goblet of wine—though his limbs are wooden puppet’s limbs, lashed to corded strings that disappear into the darkness overhead.

Madam Eva slowly exhales. "The Marionette." **Look to great heights. Find the beating heart of the castle. He waits nearby.**

As the last syllable passes her lips, the old woman freezes—and then rocks back in her chair, her eyes rolling until their whites gleam like pearls in the darkness—and then she snaps back, the candlelight burning down to its ordinary crimson glow.

The sound of the outside world returns—the voices of the Vistani, the crackling of the bonfire, the whisper of the wind, and the lapping of the waves against the shore of the pool. Light, grey and insubstantial, filters in once more through the canvas walls of the tent, and you feel yourselves breathe for the first time since the reading began. Beyond the tent’s walls, you think you can hear the sound of footsteps approaching.

Madam Eva says nothing. She only regards you silently with dark, heavy eyes.

</div>

Madam Eva refuses to elaborate on the players’ readings or provide any additional information or assistance. If asked to, she says only, “The threads of Fate cannot be beckoned like a servant or conjured like a magician’s trick. I see only what the cards show me, and no more.” Before the players leave, she whispers to them again to tell no one of what they have just heard.

**_Milestone_**. Receiving the Tarokka reading completes a story milestone. When the party exits Madam Eva’s tent, award each player 500 XP.



#### C4c. Vistani Hospitality

Upon exiting Madam Eva’s tent, the players find two other Vistani waiting outside of the tent: a woman named Eliza and a man named Arturi Radanavich. Stanimir joins the group a few moments later.

<div style="height:2px;"></div>

<blockquote>

<h5>Arturi and Eliza</h5>

**Arturi Radanavich**, a close friend of Dr. Rudolph van Richten, has recently arrived at the Tser Pool encampment. He has now heard that travelers have arrived from the village of Barovia and hopes to hear whether the Barovians have obtained any information regarding Dr. Van Richten’s whereabouts. Arturi is a thoughtful, soft-spoken man in his late thirties with a distant, almost absent-minded countenance and a near-painful sincerity.

Meanwhile, **Eliza**, one of Strahd’s spies, has heard that outsiders have entered the pool from beyond the Mists, and hopes to glean information about their goals, capabilities, and weaknesses. (Eliza had hoped to eavesdrop on the players’ Tarokka reading as well, but was foiled by Madam Eva’s foresight.) In sharp contrast to Arturi, Eliza is a cheery, excitable woman in her early thirties, always glad to insert herself into a conversation with a brash or witty comment.

</blockquote>

<div style="height:2px;"></div>

Unless the players intervene, the conversation unfolds as follows:

* Eliza greets the players immediately, giving them a warm welcome to the Tser Pool Encampment. 
* As Stanimir approaches, Eliza clicks her tongue and scolds him for his lack of hospitality, noting that the players seem to have traveled a long way. 
* Stanimir amusedly reminds Eliza that fate waits for no one, but nonetheless invites the players to rest their weary feet at the camp’s central fire, offering wine, food, and song should the players join.
* If the players accept and move to accompany Stanimir, Arturi hesitates, then asks if the players would mind if he accompanied them. He notes that he has heard that they have just arrived from Barovia, and has recently arrived at the camp himself from the west, to seek information regarding the village. (He adds, somewhat awkwardly, that it has been some time since he had last shared a Vistani fire, and apologizes for imposing upon them and the others.)

<blockquote class="wide">

<h5>The Curse of Arturi Radanavich</h5>

<div style="columns:2;">

***Dark Beginnings.*** Twenty years ago, when Arturi Radanavich was only seventeen, several members of his extended family amongst the Radanavich caravan invited him on a “hunting trip.” Awkward, lonesome, and desperate for connection, Arturi accepted their invitation gratefully.

It wasn’t long, however, before Arturi learned the true nature of their hunt. His uncle, a man named Radu Radanavich and the leader of the caravan, had recently seen his son, Ionel, fall deathly ill. When the Vistani’s treatments proved fruitless, Radu had taken Ionel to a healer in a nearby village—a doctor named Rudolph van Richten. Ionel, however, had died under Van Richten’s care, and a vengeful and grieving Radu sought to visit his pain upon Van Richten in turn.

Arturi felt bewildered and afraid—but each time he thought to open his mouth, he imagined the insults and jeers of his cousins or Uncle Radu’s smoldering glare. And so, Arturi watched silently as his family kidnapped Van Richten’s fourteen-year-old son, Erasmus, spirited him away to a darkened mire, and sold him to the vampire lord Baron Metus.

It wasn’t long after Erasmus was sold that Van Richten tracked the Vistani caravan down, ambushing the d’Avenirs—a Vistani husband and wife who then traveled with the Radanaviches and had aided Radu in his vengeance—and demanding to know where his son had been taken. Arturi later learned that Van Richten had spared the d’Avenirs’ lives—a mercy that would not last forever.

Three years later, Van Richten returned, grim-faced and surrounded by a swarm of ravenous undead. His son Erasmus had died—transformed into a vampire spawn and killed at Van Richten’s own hand. Torn by fury and grief, Van Richten released the undead horde upon the Radanavich caravan, howling, “Undead take you as you have taken my son!”

Arturi alone survived, hiding himself away in his grandmother’s magical trunk. When he finally emerged, hours later, he found the encampment shattered, his family slaughtered—and Van Richten nowhere to be found.

***Arturi's Curse.*** Arturi soon learned, however, that Van Richten’s vengeful words had taken on a life of their own, clinging to him like a burial shroud. “Undead take you,” Van Richten had promised—and so they did, pursuing Arturi wherever he went. The Vistani banished him from their camps after dusk, naming him mortu, or “outcast,” a word that can also be more directly translated as “living dead.” No village gave Arturi sanctuary; no town’s walls could protect him.

For eighteen years Arturi wandered, ever-evading his eternal pursuers. One day, however, he came upon a Vistana caravan while traveling the roads, from whom he learned that Van Richten, the murderer of Arturi’s family, had suffered beneath the weight of a curse as well—a curse placed by the raunie, or leader, of the Radanavich caravan with her dying words: “Live you always among monsters, and see everyone you love die beneath their claws!” A flutter of hope—hope that, together, their two curses may be lifted—emerged in Arturi’s heart.

Arturi spent three weeks searching for Van Richten, eventually finding him in a small cottage at the edge of a sleepy village. Concealing himself from view, Arturi watched Van Richten rage against the lives taken by the raunie’s curse, then finally crumple into sleep, alone and undefended. No lust for vengeance stirred Arturi’s hand to the dagger at his side, though—instead, he felt only commiseration and pity.

When Van Richten awoke, Arturi was there to greet him, suggesting that, together, they could aid one another and see their curses lifted. Though Arturi was not sure how, he suggested that the two spend a year traveling among the Vistani caravans, so that Van Richten could come to know the people that had taken his son, and so Arturi could come to know the man who had murdered his family. After some discussion, Van Richten reluctantly agreed.

***Redemption & Understanding.*** The two men set off together—awkwardly, at first, but soon coming to a quiet understanding. For the next twelve months, they visited each of the largest Vistani caravans in turn, exposing Van Richten to the lives, joys, and sorrows of his most hated foes. Arturi, in turn, learned of Van Richten’s grief: of the love he bore for his son, Erasmus, and the guilt he felt for his friends who had fallen.

When the year had ended, Arturi warned Van Richten that only blood could pay for his crime. Van Richten, head bowed with the weight of his guilt, promised not to resist should Arturi choose to take his life. Instead, however, Arturi sliced both their palms and took Van Richten’s hand, allowing their lifeblood to intermingle. In that moment, the two became blood-brothers, and released their hatred forever.

Somehow, the two knew that there was one thing left to do. They traveled to the old wreckage of the Radanavich caravan and set it aflame, defending its burning husk from legions of the undead that swarmed from the darkness. When dawn finally broke, the undead had gone—and the wreckage was naught more than a pile of smoking ash. The two men embraced, laughing, knowing that their curses had finally come to an end.

***The Next Chapter.*** Arturi and Van Richten parted ways soon after—Van Richten returning to his family home to compile a lifetime’s notes, and Arturi returning to the solitude of the roads, too distant from his people to truly return to their camps. Not long thereafter, Arturi’s travels took him to a southern port, where he purchased a small, trained monkey—a **baboon** named Piccolo—and had him delivered to Van Richten’s home as a memento and gift.

Several months later, Arturi heard rumors from the Vistani that Van Richten had been sighted once more—this time, in Barovia, the cursed valley of the vampire Strahd von Zarovich—and that he was now widely believed to be dead. Fearful for his friend, Arturi set off for Barovia through the Mists, hoping to find Van Richten should he still be alive—and to ensure him a proper burial should he have fallen in battle.

\pagebreakNum

If the players make their way to the Vistani fire, Eliza—and Arturi, if he is present—introduce themselves. Eliza also asks the players’ names in return. (If asked why he has not shared a Vistani fire until recently, Arturi winces and admits only that the situation is complicated.)

While seated around the fire, the players are given wine and food, including a midday meal of bread, cheese, and pickled beets. As they eat, Eliza asks the players about their next destination. If the players note that they are headed toward Vallaki or otherwise indicate an interest in staying the night, Stanimir invites them to rest at the camp overnight, noting that the roads can be long and dangerous beyond Madam Eva’s wagons.

#### C4d. The Dancing Fire

As dusk descends around the campfire, the Vistani serve the players a dinner of a hearty stew of rabbit, potatoes, turnips, lentils, and parsnips alongside hearty chunks of flatbread. 

If he hasn’t already, Arturi asks the players for news from Barovia, inquiring specifically whether they have encountered a man named Rudolph van Richten. If asked about his interest, Arturi notes sorrowfully that Van Richten is a friend of his, and that he had recently heard a rumor that he had come to harm while traveling to Barovia. Arturi is unsure whether he believes Van Richten to be dead, but is hopeful that he still lives—if for no other reason than that the old man is impressively hard to kill.

After dinner, Stanimir cheerfully informs the players that, as guests at a Vistani fire, they are now expected to play the Game of Stories, and asks whether the players will accept. To play, each participant must put up a wager, which can be an object of small monetary, intellectual, or sentimental value. Each participant must then share a story to make a man “laugh or weep.” Each time a story is told, the other participants in the game must guess whether the story is truth, falsehood, or both. At the end of the game, the participant with the most correct guesses wins the pot.

If the players accept the challenge, Eliza, Arturi, and Ireena also offer to join the game. The participants’ wagers are as follows:

* **Stanimir** wagers a worn deck of Tarokka cards that once belonged to his late wife. (“They’ve sat unused and dusty in my wagon for long enough,” he says with a sad smile. “I think she’d like it if they were out in the world again.”)
* **Eliza** wagers a collapsible brass spyglass with a small, maneuverable mirror, allowing the user to peer around corners.
* **Arturi** wagers a short manuscript on werewolves authored by Dr. Rudolph van Richten.
* **Ireena** wagers a painted wooden hairclip in the shape of a sunflower that she once wore as a child.

Give the players a few minutes away from the table to plan out their stories before the game begins.

<div style="height:2px"></div>

<blockquote class="wide">


<h5>Arturi’s Manuscript</h5>


Arturi’s manuscript—authored by Dr. Rudolph van Richten—is two pages long. It is titled “A Study of the Werewolf’s Curse,” and reads as follows:

<div style="columns:2;">



<div style="height:2px"></div>

*Werewolves are among the most fearsome lycanthropes, bearing a curse as ancient as it is terrifying. For them, the affliction of lycanthropy transforms even the most civilized individual into a monstrous beast, warping the lines betwixt man and nature.*

*In its humanoid form, a werewolf retains many of the characteristics of its original identity, save for certain nuances such as heightened senses, an explosive temper, and an odd preference for rare meats. Over time, subtle features that hint at their animalistic nature begin to manifest. Nevertheless, it is in their wolf and hybrid forms that the true horror of the curse is revealed. A werewolf's hybrid form is particularly terrifying, with a muscular humanoid body crowned by the head of a ravenous wolf. It is capable of wielding weapons, though its favored means of attack are its devastating claws and powerful bite.*

*Werewolves typically abandon civilization soon after their transformation. Those who reject the curse flee in fear of harming their loved ones, whereas those who accept it fear exposure and the repercussions of their violent deeds. Out in the wild, they form packs, living in cohesion with ordinary wolves and dire wolves alike.*

*The most tragic aspect of lycanthropy is its transmission. A humanoid can contract this curse through a wound inflicted by a lycanthrope or through inheritance if one or both of its parents are lycanthropes.*



*The cursed have two paths: they may resist the beast within or embrace it. Those who resist bear unending strain—until the rising full moon triggers a compulsory and horrific transformation. These individuals often experience bloody, haunting dreams: echoes of the carnage wrought in their madness.*

*Some twisted souls, however, choose to accept their beastly nature. With time, they can master their abilities, calling upon the wolf's resilience and strength as they will. To do so, however, they must first perform a gruesome act: to murder another and consume their flesh.*

*One sure way to identify an afflicted individual is the presence of a perpetually raw, bloody wound, the scar of the initial curse transmission. This wound never fully heals until the curse is lifted.*

*Beyond this mark, however, these creatures bear an extraordinary resilience. Conventional methods of harm prove ineffective in permanently subduing a werewolf. Only through the bite of silver or the chilling touch of death can a werewolf be truly put to rest.*

*A spell of removal can also cure an afflicted lycanthrope, though those who accept the beast may fight it bitterly. As for those unfortunate souls born under the curse, they are doomed to bear their affliction for life. As far as my research has shown, there exists no cure, no respite for such individuals. They are caught in an eternal struggle, forever haunted by the wolf within.*

##### Stanimir’s Tale

Stanimir goes first, delivering the same tale as described in **The Dancing Fire** (p. 20). However, exclude the final paragraph, and instead end with the sentence, “The figure in the dancing fire vanquishes its final foe, then disperses in a cloud of smoke and embers.” Throughout his tale, the players can notice Stanimir using the *major image* spell to create the shapes in the flames.

When his tale has ended and all participants have made their guesses—Eliza and Arturi going last, with Eliza voting “True” and Arturi voting “Half-True”—Stanimir reveals that his story was indeed a true tale of the Vistani people, and that the wounded prince lived on as a friend to the Vistani, even when his heart was led astray by shadows and mist. (If asked, Stanimir admits that the prince was Strahd von Zarovich in the days before he came to Barovia, and that his promise to the Vistani is why they remain in the valley to this day, “without fear or favor.”)

##### Eliza’s Tale

After one of the players has gone, Eliza then shares the following tale:

<div class="descriptive">

“It is said that within each raven flutters a lost soul, and that each raven’s song tells a tale of ages past. They whisper, so listen closely.”

She takes a deep breath; when she speaks again, her voice is quiet, with an eerie, melodic quality to it.

“Sing, ravens, of Barovia, birthed from the mists and bathed in twilight. Sing of Lugdana, the Morninglord’s stalwart, dawn-touched foe to the deep-lurking dark. The Holy Symbol of Ravenkind, her radiant testament, the warrior’s beacon of faithful resolve.

“Sing, ravens, of Chernovog’s rise, named Green-God and Demon-Lord upon Yester Hill. Lugdana, gray-haired, weary of battle, her longsword and shield yet polished and ready. Guided through shadows, toward sacred ground, she clashed with the demon, their tempest-like dance.

“Sing, ravens, of Lugdana’s last fury, of Ravenkind’s token now blazing with light. The battle’s tide turning, a hero’s brave cry, a final onslaught with divinity’s grace. The Demon-Lord banished, the warrior now fell, the wound at her side gouged too deep to bear.

“Sing, ravens, of light’s final moments, a shadow descending from radiance on high. Sing of the angel, black-feathered and beaked, the Morninglord’s angel reclaiming its gift. The Symbol retaken, in ravens’ claws held.

“Sing, ravens; you are the keepers, the watchers, the tellers of stories untold. Sing, ravens, of Lugdana’s memory, the shadows that lurk, and heroes to come.”

</div> 

When her tale has ended and all participants have made their guesses—Stanimir and Arturi going last, with Stanimir voting “True” and Arturi voting “False”—Eliza reveals that her story was half-true. 

Lugdana was indeed a paladin of the Morninglord who bore the legendary *Holy Symbol of Ravenkind*. According to legend, the symbol was given to Lugdana by an angel in the guise of a raven. Eliza notes with a chuckle, however, that no one knows what happened to the Symbol after Lugdana fell at Yester Hill, nor where it resides today.

##### Arturi’s Tale

After three of the players have gone, Arturi then shares the following tale:

<div class="descriptive">

“There was once a silver Fox, renowned among all for his curative touch. On a cold, moonlit night, however, a rustle of wings disturbed his peaceful reprieve. A flock of Sparrows brought him one of their own, the tendrils of Death clutching its small, shivering body. The Silver Fox took the sickly sparrow into his den, but with all his wisdom and skill, he could not cure its ailment, and it breathed its last in his paws.

“Fearing the Sparrows’ anger, the Fox begged them to take anything in exchange for peace. The Sparrows, hearts filled with grief, departed into the moonlit night. It was only at dawn that the Fox realized what they had taken: His beloved kit had vanished, taken by the Sparrows’ claws.

“The Fox pursued the sparrows through barren lands and shadowed woods. He found them slumbering amidst the branches of a gnarled tree—and, in his cleverness, snatched two of their flock in the jaws of his teeth.

“‘Where is my kit?’ the silver Fox roared. The Sparrows, now prey in his claws, shared the terrible truth: they had given his kit to the Kingdom of Night, where the cursed Sovereign of Dusk dwelled in the darkness.

“And so the Fox passed from light into dark, his legs aching and sore, his paws bramble-pricked and bloody. It was in the keep of Dusk’s Sovereign that he found his lost quarry—and uncovered his kit’s dreadful fate. His kit now shared the Sovereign’s curse,  the features of life now twisted and warped, his once-lively eyes now deadened and cold.

The kit begged for reprieve—for his father to free him from his cursed existence. And the silver Fox, with a heart heavier than the mountains, with eyes stinging with tears, did the unthinkable—and ended his kit’s torment. As the Fox’s anguished howl shattered the night, so, too, did his heart. A father had entered the Kingdom that day, but it was a phantom, born of anguish and rage, that vanished into the shrouded night.”

</div>

When his tale has ended and all participants have made their guesses—Stanimir and Eliza going last, with Stanimir voting “True” and Eliza voting “False”—Arturi reveals that his story was true. He politely declines, however, to reveal anything further, noting only, with a sad smile, that “Some stories are not mine to tell.”

##### Ireena’s Tale

After all of the players have gone, Ireena (if present) then shares the following tale:

\pagebreakNum

<div class="descriptive">

"When I was a child, my father took me and my brother to a vast, tranquil lake. I remember the sand beneath my bare feet, and the lapping of the waves against the shore. 

"But then, something broke the silence—a low growl that echoed through the wind. As I turned, I saw a beast emerge from the fog: a wolf, far larger than any I'd ever seen. I still remember its eyes—yellow, cold, and hungry.

"My father screamed for me to run. I took off for the woods, and the wolf followed, its snarls echoing through the underbrush. I remember branches whipping against my face, thorns cutting at my feet as my legs burned and my breath grew ragged, but my fear drove me forward.

"It was only much later, when my heart had quieted in my chest and the wolf's footsteps had faded into silence, that I finally allowed myself to stop. By then, though, the woods were strange to me, and my father's shouts had faded. 

"A heavy mist had descended around me, and shadowed shapes lurked in every corner. I stepped forward, one hand reaching fearfully into the fog—and a wolf made of mist leapt forth, its jaws opened wide to devour me. And then—everything went black.

"The next thing I remembered, I awoke in my own bed, my father's humming echoing from the kitchen. I don't know how I got there, or what became of the wolf, but I can still remember its teeth as clearly as ever."

</div>

When her tale has ended and all participants have made their guesses—Stanimir voting “True” and Eliza and Arturi voting “False”—Ireena reveals that her story was false. With a quiet laugh, she shares that the story is a dream that she’s had since childhood, noting that there are no lakes near the village of Barovia and that she’d never seen a **dire wolf** until recently.

If challenged on his vote, Stanimir merely says, with a mysterious smile, that many dreams have a kernel of truth. He then thanks Ireena for sharing her tale.

<div style="height:2px;"></div>

<blockquote>

<h5>Confronting Arturi</h5>

If one of the players confronts Arturi after the Game of Stories has ended and suggests that the Silver Fox of his tale is a pseudonym for Dr. Rudolph van Richten, Arturi graciously admits it. He notes, wistfully, that Van Richten has suffered many pains in life—some just, some unjust—but that, in due time, he found healing and redemption for both his sins and the sins of others. Arturi says, however, that the continuation of Van Richten’s tale is not for him to tell. 

Arturi does note, though, that Van Richten *did* later find precious friends who began to heal his broken heart, including his student Ezmerelda d’Avenir. He concludes by sharing his hopes that Van Richten still lives, if only so that he may one day find the peace he has long searched for.

</blockquote>

#### C4e. A Gift for Arabelle

As the players prepare to depart Tser Pool, they are approached by Madam Eva, who greets them with a friendly cackle.

Once pleasantries are disposed of, she proffers a velvet pouch containing ten gold coins and asks the players to bring it to Blinsky Toys, in Vallaki, to purchase a toy for her great-grand-niece, Arabelle. Blinsky’s, she notes with a twinkle in her eye, are Arabelle’s favorites. (She adds that the players are welcome to keep any change as payment for their efforts.)

Once they’ve purchased the toy, Madam Eva asks the players to deliver it to the Vistani encampment to the southwest of Vallaki by the end of Arabelle’s tenth nameday, which is in two days’ time. Eva claims that she would go herself, but that long journeys are simply too taxing upon her old bones. She adds, with a cryptic and knowing smile, that the players may enjoy speaking with Arabelle upon meeting her, as she is “a most interesting child.”

Madam Eva concludes the conversation by wishing the players well on their journey. She then returns to her tent.

### C5. The Skeletal Rider

When the players return to the River Ivlis Crossroads after receiving the Tarokka reading, they encounter a skeletal rider, as described in **Skeletal Rider** (p. 31). 

### C6. The Watchtower

As the players travel west from the River Ivlis Crossroads, read:

<div class="descriptive">


You leave the crossroads behind and resume your westward journey. You follow the road as it bends around, then ascends the cliff, trudging up its steep, rocky incline. 

The fog is thick here, obscuring the top of the cliff overhead. The road itself grows narrow and treacherous, with loose stones and deep ruts that make it difficult to maintain your footing. 

Soon enough, though, the road levels out, continuing past a ruined three-story watchtower perched atop the edge of the cliff. 

The tower's old stone walls are covered in moss and ivy, its rotten wooden door hanging off its hinges. Nearby, two fresh graves sit against the road. An animal's corpse seems to lie in the tall grass not far away.

</div>

Pause to allow the players to act or react. If the players remain silent, continue to **Tser Falls** below. Otherwise, allow the players to explore the area.

#### The Watchtower

The ruined watchtower was built as a lookout post by the Order of the Silver Dragon long ago. It has the same structure as the **Guard Tower**  (p. 157) at Tsolenka Pass, with the following changes:

* The tower door has been half-pulled from its hinges and can be opened easily.
* The temperature and wind in the tower are far less severe.

\pagebreakNum

* There is no dire wolf's head mounted above the hearth.
* There are neither statues nor skeletons atop the battlements.

If the players explore the watchtower, they find a broken pendant of a silver dragon lying on the ground of the first floor, close to the entrance. The pendant is always cold to the touch.

From atop the battlements of the watchtower, the players can see Tser Falls to the northwest and Tser Pool to the northeast. To the south, above and beyond the slopes of Mount Ghakis, they can see only an impenetrable wall of thick, gray fog.

#### The Graves

The two graves hold the remains of two Barovian refugees who were slain by wolves during the journey to Vallaki some time ago. A DC 12 Wisdom (Survival) check reveals that the graves are no more than a few days old.

Small pebbles have been arranged in the soil atop each grave to form the shape of a rising sunburst.

#### The Corpse

The corpse belongs to a wolf killed by spears and crossbow bolts. The Barovian refugees left it here after slaying it and driving off the other members of its pack.

### C7. Tser Falls

The journey from the River Ivlis Crossroads to Tser Falls is seven-and-a-half miles long, or two-and-a-half hours.

#### The High Road

As the players travel west on the Old Svalich Road, read:


<div class="descriptive">

You continue down the winding mountain road, the jagged peaks looming ominously through the fog far above. 

The air grows colder as the road passes through a dark evergreen forest, the thick canopy once more blocking out much of the sky's dim light. The only sounds that follow you are the crunching of fallen leaves and an occasional rustling in the underbrush.

</div>

While traversing this section of the Old Svalich Road, the players are stalked by one of Strahd's spies: a **wolf.** (See **Strahd's Spies** on pg. 29 for more information.)

If the players dispatch, ignore, or fail to notice the wolf, continue:

<div class="descriptive">

As you curve around the edge of the mountain, the right-hand cliffs fall away, leaving a sheer drop to a forested gully below. The road bends, doubling back around this ravine before plunging dramatically and winding around a smaller mountain peak. 

</div>

The players then arrive at **Tser Falls** (p. 37).

\columnbreak

#### Tser Falls

This area is largely as described in **Tser Falls** (p. 37). Additionally, when the players arrive, they can see a **revenant** (p. 31) standing alone at the midpoint of the bridge with its hands resting on the pommel of its sword, the blade of which is planted firmly on the ground. 

If the players call out to this nameless **revenant** or step onto the bridge, it hails them in a raspy voice and asks their business. Upon hearing their response, it says, "Old things are stirring and the lord of Castle Ravenloft roams the valley. Tell me: Do you serve him?"

If the players claim to serve Strahd, the revenant visibly stiffens, but stands aside, saying coldly, "Then be gone on your way, and may your foul work bring you ruin and despair."

If the players deny serving Strahd, the revenant is visibly relieved and invites them to approach so that it may "get a closer look at them." It introduces itself as a knight of the Order of the Silver Dragon, but claims to have long forgotten its name in life. 

<div style="height:2px;"></div>

<blockquote>

<h5>Vladimir’s Fury</h5>

This nameless **revenant** was banished, along with a dozen of its peers, from the ruins of Argynvostholt shortly after the failure of Doru’s rebellion three months ago. 

When news of Strahd’s planned counterstroke reached them, the knights of the Order of the Silver Dragon raised their voices, begging Vladimir Horngaard to allow them to lend their swords to the cause. 

Vladimir denied them and, when the knights grew enraged and unruly, banished them from the manor and forbade them from raising their swords against Strahd or any of his creatures. Now, only Sir Godfrey Gwilym, Vladimir Horngaard, and the spirits of the **phantom warriors** that once fought for the Order remain in Argynvostholt.

</blockquote>

<div style="height:2px;"></div>

If the players' weapons are clearly visible, it asks the players if they oppose the lord of Castle Ravenloft. If the players claim to oppose Strahd, the revenant advises them to travel to Argynvostholt to the west, where Sir Godfrey Gwilym awaits those who would raise their swords against the darkness that lurks in the castle's depths.

If the players inquire about the Order of the Silver Dragon, the revenant shares only that the knights of the Order opposed the lord of Ravenloft in life and suggests that the players speak with Sir Godfrey to obtain further information. If the players obtained the silver pendant in the watchtower by the River Ivlis Crossroad, the revenant recognizes it, but refuses to comment further on its significance.

If the players ask the revenant why it is guarding the bridge, it says only, "Because I raised my voice against my commander and was banished. Now, I stand like my brothers- and sisters-in-arms, watching the dark places of this land and awaiting an order that will never come." 

\pagebreakNum

If the players ask why it cannot take up arms against Strahd itself, it says only, "Because my commander forbids it, and my spirit is bound from disobeying his will." It is willing to share that its commander's name is Sir Vladimir Horngaard, but is unwilling to share more, advising the players to speak with Sir Godfrey instead.

If the players ask for directions to Argynvostholt, the revenant advises them to travel "west, beyond the walled town, then south upon the ash-gray path."

If the players mention Strahd's carriage, the revenant notes its disgust for "the beast von Zarovich" and advises the players to be cautious of him and his servants and spies. If the players mention the skeletal rider, the revenant recalls that "the Wandering One has long sought a road to freedom through the mists. It has never succeeded."

The revenant will not leave its post on the bridge under any circumstances.

### C8. Black Carriage

The journey from Tser Falls to the **Black Carriage** (p. 37) is one-and-a-half miles and takes thirty minutes. As the players make this journey, read:


<div class="descriptive">

You continue down the winding road, which climbs a short distance north before bending west to avoid a bald-headed peak on the right, its craggy cliffs bearing an array of sharp rocks that jut out over the roadway.


It's not long before the road bends north once again, a second hill arising from the fog on your left. Twisted trees dot its steep slopes, their branches reaching out like gnarled fingers.

As you travel deeper between the hills, the road narrows and the cliffs grow taller. Soon, though, the hills fall away once more, the road continuing forth into a small, fog-choked basin.

</div>


This area is as described in **Black Carriage** (p. 37). (Strahd's carriage is not present, though the players can see deep grooves in the muddy road that pass from the Old Svalich Road onto the old cobblestone-strewn thoroughfare that leads to Castle Ravenloft.)

The journey from the Black Carriage to the western **Gates of Barovia** is a quarter-mile and takes five minutes. This area is as described in **Gates of Barovia** (p. 38), but seen from the opposite side.

### C9. Old Bonegrinder

The journey from the Gates of Ravenloft to **Old Bonegrinder** is two-and-a-half miles long and takes forty-five minutes. As the players make this journey, read:

<div class="descriptive">

The road continues forward, passing between a patch of dark woods. The air here is as quiet as the grave, the trees standing perfectly still in the unnerving silence.

Not far from the road, nestled in the overgrown underbrush, stands a mossy stone slab standing just under six feet in height. It rests on an old, cracked stone circle, and seems to bear some kind of carving.

</div>



<img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1OvWTgwudmSRegQyggVK2ZxVKkv13NhI4" alt="" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: -350px; height: 100%;">

1Nt2ogCzClCDm24JrAR-KVPwB0c9CRT_U
" style="position: absolute; left: 0px; top: 0px;">

\pagebreakNum

Briefly pause to allow the players to act or react. If the players choose to investigate the slab, they find that it bears a crude carving of a wolf's head, the grooves lined with lichen and moss. (The slab is an ancient monument to the Huntress, one of the Ladies Three.) 


If the players remain silent or continue ahead, read:

<div class="descriptive">

The road soon emerges from the woods once more, veering between two hills. Before long, it bends to the north, hugging the base of a mountain.

</div>

The players emerge at the base of the hill upon which **Old Bonegrinder** rests, as described in **Approaching the Windmill** (p. 125).

As the windmill comes into view, the players also notice **Morgantha** approaching from the opposite direction with her cart, as described in **Dream Pastries** (p. 48). 

This scene largely unfolds as described in **Dream Pastries** (p. 48), but with the following changes:

* Morgantha is coming from the town of Vallaki, not the village of Barovia.
* Morgantha doesn't have a child stuffed into a sack in her peddler's cart.
* Morgantha doesn't avoid the players.

Morgantha greets the players warmly, calling them "weary travelers," and shares her hope that the road has not been too hard on them. She freely shares the following information if asked:

* She is a peddler who sells baked wares to the "good people of Barovia."
* She is just returning from a day peddling her goods to the townsfolk of Vallaki and the "poor, hungry dears" camped outside the gates. (Her latter comment is referring to a camp of Barovian refugees that has not been allowed to enter the town.)
* She lives in the old windmill up the hill with her two daughters, Bella and Offalia. (She kindly declines to share what happened to her "husband," saying only, "Now, that's an old woman's business, meant to be shared only if she chooses.")

Morgantha has a few "dream pastries" left from her workday—"filled with the light and love of dreaming"—which she offers to the players for free as a "first sample." She advises the players that the dream pastries taste best after a warm meal, "especially with a nice bit of wine to wash them down."

If asked how she manages to travel the roads safely, Morgantha only smiles and promises the players that "an old woman has her tricks." ("But," she complains, "my back and poor feet do complain from time to time. I can't wait to soak them in a tub of nice, hot water once I'm home.")

When the conversation runs out of steam, Morgantha bids the players a safe journey, and lets them know that they can find her outside of Vallaki's gates in the future, should they like to purchase additional pastries.

The dream pastries, if eaten, affect the players as described in **Dream Pastries** (p. 125).

\columnbreak

### C10. The Deep Woods

The journey from Old Bonegrinder to the **Town of Vallaki** is five-and-three-quarter miles long and takes two hours. As the players make this journey, read:

<div class="descriptive">

The winding valley road hugs the mountainside as it meanders north. The dark woods cling to the opposite side of the road, the tall, gnarled trees creeping as close as they dare. You can hear the sound of the wind rustling through the leaves and the occasional creak of branches. From time to time, it almost sounds like the trees are whispering among themselves, or stirring their ancient roots in the old, rotten mulch.

As the road continues, the forest swallows it up on both sides. The trees towering far above your heads, blocking out all but the barest hints of gray light. The air grows thick and heavy with the scent of moss and rotting leaves; in the distance, you hear a raven's gurgling croak, followed by the sound of fluttering wings.

Before long, it becomes clear that your presence in this dreary land has not gone unnoticed. A raven follows you for several minutes while keeping a respectful distance.

</div>


This encounter unfolds as described in **Swarms of Ravens** (p. 32), with the party joined by two **swarms of ravens**. If she is with the party and able to fly, the disguised Muriel takes wing alongside the flock, but keeps a sharp eye on the players as they travel. 

As the players proceed down the road, read:


<div class="descriptive">

Ahead, the trees to the north break, revealing a grassy field. The tall grasses sway in the chill air, the field stretching until it reaches the shores of a dark, distant lake. Fog clings to the shoreline. Even from a distance, you can hear the faint sound of water lapping against the rocks.

</div>

If Ireena is with the party, she freezes and asks the players if the party can take a quick detour across the field to the lake. If asked, she notes only that the lake seems strangely familiar.

Lake Zarovich is as described in **L. Lake Zarovich** (p. 38), but without the beached rowboats or Bluto's boat visible. 

Upon arriving at the shore of the lake, Ireena notes with trepidation that it appears to be the same lake that she has seen in her dreams. (If she hasn't already shared it, Ireena tells the story of her dream, described in ***C4d. The Dancing Fire*** above.)

Ireena is certain, however, that she has never visited this lake with Ismark and her father, Kolyan. She is uncertain of the implications, but becomes lost in thought if a player reminds her that her father found her wandering the Old Svalich Woods as a child.

\pagebreakNum

### C11. The Werewolf's Hunt

As the players continue down the road, read:


<div class="descriptive">

As quickly as it appeared, the field is swallowed up by the forest again, the trees closing in around you once more. The dark undergrowth rustles and stirs in the wind, and the weight of the forest presses in from all sides. You're unable to shake the sense that, somehow, you're being watched.

</div>

If one of the players has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14 or higher, or if one of the players makes a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check, add:

<div class="descriptive">

As your footsteps squelch into the old, muddy road, you glimpse a flicker of movement in the underwood: a flash of gray fur, amber eyes, and sharp, white teeth. Then, as soon as it appeared, it vanishes, skulking back into the shadows.

</div>

The movement belongs to a **wolf**. Its six **wolf** packmates—led by a single **werewolf** (in wolf form)—are not far behind.

Soon after the first wolf appears, the pack attacks. Read:

<div class="descriptive">

The woodland road takes you through a small, forested clearing, the circular treeline littered with dense thickets, moss-covered boulders, and craggy ridges. Then, without warning, eight snarling shadows launch from the underbrush, fangs bared and claws outstretched!

</div>

Have the players, **wolves**, **werewolf** (in wolf form), and (if they are with the party) Ireena, the two **swarms of ravens**, and Muriel (a **wereraven** in raven form) roll initiative. Any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score lower than 14 is surprised.

Each wolf gains the following additional action option:

* ***Maul.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (2d4 + 2) piercing damage. Instead of dealing damage, the wolf can grapple the target (escape DC 11).


In combat, the **wolves** work together, using their ***Bite*** to knock characters prone, then using their ***Maul*** to grapple prone targets. Once the wolves have dragged a grappled character away from the party, the **werewolf** shifts its attention to target them with its ***bite***. The first character targeted in this way notices that the werewolf is slightly larger than the rest and has intelligent, disturbingly human eyes.

The werewolf flees if it begins its turn with 10 hit points or fewer and doesn’t regenerate. Any surviving wolves follow soon after. If the werewolf dies, it reverts to its true form: a young man with pale, freckled skin and a lean, muscled frame.


<blockquote>

<h5>Lycanthrope Regeneration</h5>

Remember that, rather than immunity or resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage made with nonsilvered weapons, all lycanthropes that have either transformed or embraced their curse gain the following feature:

* ***Regeneration.*** The lycanthrope regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the lycanthrope takes necrotic damage or damage from a silvered weapon, this trait doesn’t function at the start of the lycanthrope’s next turn. The lycanthrope dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn’t regenerate.

</blockquote>

\pagebreakNum

### C11. The Town of Vallaki

#### C11a. The Vallakian Gates

The road continues forward to the **Town of Vallaki**, largely as described in **Approaching the Town** (p. 95). However, remove the first sentence of the descriptive text and add the following text at the end of the first paragraph: 

<div class="descriptive">

More than a dozen ramshackle tents have been set up against the palisade wall. Among them, dozens of ragged, emaciated people mill about or sit by low-burning campfires and bedrolls, their hollow gazes watching silently as you approach.

</div>

If Ireena is visibly traveling with the party, add:

<div class="descriptive">

Some of them regard Ireena with dull recognition, but none lift a hand in greeting or make any gesture of warmth.

</div>

This area, the Morning Gate, is largely as described in **Town Gates** (p. 95). The tents are a camp of Barovian refugees, housing those who survived the trek from the village of Barovia in the wake of Strahd's siege.

##### The Refugee Camp

If she is with the party, Ireena is heartbroken and enraged at the sight of the refugee camp. She suggests that she meet with the refugees while the players find lodging in town, and promises to join the players later. The players can dissuade her with a successful DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check. Otherwise, Ireena approaches one of the cookfires, either alone or—if the players have insisted on joining her—with company.

The members of the refugee camp, which include Emeric, a melancholy older man, and Mathilda, a grief-stricken young woman, can share the following information:

* The Barovian refugees arrived at Vallaki's gates a few days ago, but were barred from entering. When they attempted to breach the gates by force, the guards summoned a man they called Izek, who bore a twisted devil's arm and conjured fire to drive the refugees back.
* Since then, the refugees have set up camp outside the town's walls, clustering together for protection and warmth. They've managed to secure some minor necessities, such as the tents, by bribing the guards at the gates, but have been unable to persuade the guards to allow them entry or to even invite the town's Baron to discuss their plight.
* Swarms of bats and packs of wolves have plagued the camp each night since they've arrived. Thankfully, no one has died yet, but several refugees have been wounded.
* Due to losses they suffered on the road and the threat of the Devil in Castle Ravenloft, the refugees are unwilling to risk the journey back home, instead hoping to wait until the Baron sees reason and allows them to enter the walls.
* Roughly one-quarter of the refugees have become addicted to "dream pastries," a foodstuff sold by the peddler Morgantha. These refugees seek an escape from the misery and despair of their situation. Those who eat a dream pastry fall into a trance as described in **Dream Pastries** (p. 125).

The refugees are lost in despair. Many are cold toward Ireena, and all are unwilling to accept her offers of help. Some blame her, as well as Ismark "the Lesser" and the late Burgomaster of Barovia, for their failure to prevent Strahd's awakening and invasion. Others recall a superstition that red-haired Barovian woman bring misfortune, and suggest that Ireena herself has brought a curse upon their people. None have any wish to deal with her further.

Following her interaction with the refugees, Ireena is further enraged by the Baron's evident callousness, and vows to make her best efforts to secure entry for the refugees into Vallaki. 


\pagebreakNum

##### The Guards at the Gates

The guards at the gates largely act as described in **Town Gates** (p. 95). However, the guards demand that each person first identify themselves, then pay 1 gold piece as a toll in order to enter the village. (The Baron has imposed this law to prevent werewolves or Vistani from entering the town.)

> ##### Ireena's Diplomacy
>
> The day after she speaks with the refugees for the first time, Ireena attempts to meet with the Baron, using her noble birth as a means of obtaining his attention. Though she expects to meet with him alone, she welcomes the players' support and assistance if offered.
>
> During their meeting, assuming the players do not interfere, the Baron dismisses out of hand any suggestion that the refugees be allowed to enter the town. However, he does allow Ireena to come and go from the town into the refugee camp without requiring her to pay the toll at the gates.
>
> If the players are present at this meeting and befriend or antaognize the Baron, he responds as described in **Roleplaying the Vallakovich Family** (p. 105).


The guards refuse to accept payment on behalf of the refugees, who the Baron has specifically barred from entering, claiming concerns of "sickness, unruliness, and malicious unhappiness."

If the players pay the toll, the guards also insist that each entrant opens their purse (or equivalent) and surrender any silver pieces in their possession. (If the players complain, the guards assure them that the silver is needed to produce the silvered weapons necessary to defend the town from werewolves.) In exchange for any silver coins that they give up, the players receive an amount of copper coins of equal value—minus a ten percent tax.

If asked about lodging, the guards can share information about the Blue Water Inn, as described in **Vallaki Lore** (p. 96). The guards are also willing to provide additional directions to other landmarks in the town in exchange for a bribe of 1 gold piece.

Each time the players pass through the gates, including the first, the guards nod at them and intone the Baron's favored phrase: "All will be well."

##### Entering the Town

As the players pass down Vallaki's main avenue, read:

<div class="descriptive">

You pass from the earthen road onto cobblestone streets, mud staining your boots and the bottoms of your pants. Behind you, the gate closes with a slam, and you can see the guards resume their posts behind it. In the distance, you can see two other figures bearing pikes, patrolling the walls as they look down on the twisted forest beyond.

The eaves of the buildings hang with old banners and tattered fabrics that flap and twist in the chill breeze. The banners are painted with faded words and illustrations, but time has robbed them of both their legibility and any beauty they may have once had.

</div>

If the players arrive during the day, add:

<div class="descriptive">

The streets are filled sparsely with townsfolk, many wearing drab, patched grey clothes that have faded with age. They shrink back toward the sides of the streets as you pass, their pale faces growing paler with faint fear at the sight of you. Their frightened eyes linger on your strange appearances, and quiet whispers fill the air.

A few townsfolk bear strained, silent smiles, but no mirth reaches their eyes. There's not a glint of hope or joy—only weariness, tainted with fear.

As you pass by them, the tension leaves the townsfolk and they return quietly to their business.

</div>

Otherwise, if the players arrive at night, add:

<div class="descriptive">

Flickering candlelight lingers behind the shuttered townhouse windows, and humanoid shadows move beyond closed curtains. Long shadows lurk in the alleyways, where the grass grows long and twisted beneath the stained and sagging wood of the buildings above. The streets are empty, though you can see a single cloaked figure traveling away from you down the central road.  In the distance beyond the walls, a lone wolf howls, and a cold gust of wind cuts through the night like a knife.

</div>

The cloaked figure is Willemina Rikalova, as described in **St. Andral's Church** (p. 97). She is traveling to the church to pray for the freedom of her son, Udo Lukovich.

As the characters pass through the streets, they are noticed by Ernst Larnak, who intently watches them—though doesn't follow them—as described in **Lady Wachter's Wish** (p. 124). (Ernst does not yet deliver an invitation to dine with Lady Wachter, though he does return to **N4. Wachterhaus** (p. 110) to report back to Lady Wachter when the players leave his sight.)

#### C11b. The Blue Water Inn

This area is largely as described in **N2. Blue Water Inn** (p. 98).

When the players first arrive, assuming they arrive between late afternoon and early evening, the inn contains the following notable NPCs:

* Danika Martikov, who is pouring drinks and serving patrons in the **N2c. Taproom**; 
* Urwin Martikov, who is cooking bread and beet stew in the **N2e. Kitchen**;
* Brom and Bray Martikov, who are playing with toys in **N20. Boys' Bedroom**; and
* Rictavio, who is feeding his horse, Drusilla, in **N2f. Stable**.

##### Entering the Inn

When the players first enter the inn, Danika greets them and asks them to wait at the bar while she tends to other patrons.

If the characters approach the bar, Urwin exits the kitchen carrying a tray of fresh-baked bread, hot beet stew, and wolf steaks, which he sets down on the bar. (The food smells mouthwateringly delicious.) 

Urwin greets the players warmly and welcomes them to the Blue Water Inn. If the players don't direct the conversation elsewhere, he notes that they look like travelers and asks if they need rooms for the night.

Before Urwin can reply to the players, Danika returns and apologizes to the players for her delay. Assuming the players do not interrupt, the conversation then proceeds as follows:


* Danika lightheartedly accuses Urwin of plotting to rent rooms to guests "for free" again, an allegation that Urwin cheerfully denies. 
* Danika tells the players that Urwin has already let one other guest stay for free for almost a month, and would "bankrupt the inn" with generosity if she weren't there to keep the books. Urwin graciously concedes the point.) 
* "After all," Urwin says cheekily, "why else did I marry you?" With a smile, Danika replies, "A rare instance of common sense, I imagine."
* Danika pecks Urwin's cheek with a kiss and says, "The table by the window is getting hungry." Urwin winks at the players, picks up the tray again, and exits the bar to deliver the food.

Danika then tells the players the the rates for room and board, as listed in **N2. Blue Water Inn** (p. 98). (Both the large guest room, **N2m. Guest Room** (p. 102), as well as the two small guest rooms, **N2l. Guest Rooms** (p. 102), are available for rent.) When Urwin returns, he offers to take the players' orders for dinner, assuming they're hungry. 

The players then have a few minutes to talk with Urwin and Danika or amongst themselves. During this conversation, Urwin and Danika can provide the players with information about Rictavio, the Festival of the Blazing Sun, and the nearby Vistani camp, as described in **Vallaki Lore** (p. 96). 

\pagebreakNum

Both Urwin and Danika can provide directions to any major landmark inside of Vallaki, including **N1. St. Andral's Church**, **N5. Arasek Stockyard**, and **N8. Town Square**. If the players ask about the inn's other guest, Urwin and Danika can also share information about Rictavio, as described in **N2c. Taproom** (p. 100).

The inn's most recent shipment of wine is slightly late, but has not been sufficiently delayed as to make Urwin alarmed. As such, he does not ask the players to investigate the Wizard of Wines at this point. (This quest will not become available until the players reach level 5. See **Arc L: The Missing Gems** for more information.) [&#x5b;Note&#x5d;]

##### The Wolf-Hunters Arrive

If the players order food or wine in the taproom, Danika offers to seat them at the long table at the south end of the taproom. (See **Map 5.2: Blue Water Inn**.) While the players wait to be served, Szoldar Szoldarovich and Yevgeni Krushkin enter the inn and proceed to the bar, where they order pints of wine.


Assuming the players do not interrupt, they can overhear the following conversation between Danika, Szoldar, and Yevgeni while Danika pours the wolf-hunters' drinks:


* Danika greets Szoldar and Yevgeni and asks how the day's "wolf hunt" has gone.
* Szoldar tells Danika that they've managed to kill several wolves in the Svalich Wood west of Vallaki, but more keep coming—both ordinary wolves and horse-sized dire wolves.
* Danika thanks the two for their work, and notes that the inn will need another shipment of wolf steaks soon, an order that Szoldar promises to fill.

Szoldar and Yevgeni then take two seats at the south side of the bar, where they nurse their drinks for the rest of the evening.

If the players approach them and strike up a conversation, Szoldar and Yevgeni are largely as described in **N2c. Taproom** (p. 100). Additionally, the wolf-hunters can tell the players about the danger of fishing on Lake Zarovich, the nearby Vistani camp, the haunted mansion to the west, and the abandoned village to the south, as described in **Vallaki Lore** (p. 96).

##### Dinner is Served

Shortly after Szoldar and Yevgeni are served their drinks, if the players ordered dinner, Danika approaches their table with a tray of food. As she serves them, she is suddenly jostled from behind, sending one of the bowls of soup tumbling from her grasp. The two players sitting at the northernmost end of the table must make DC 10 Dexterity saving throws, catching the bowl on a success. (If both players succeed, the player with the higher result catches the bowl first. If neither player succeeds, the bowl topples onto the floor, spilling the soup.) [&#x5b;Note&#x5d;]

Danika turns, revealing the culprit: a red-cheeked Brom Martikov wearing one of the painted wooden clown masks as described in **N2o. Boy' Bedroom** (p. 102). (Bray Martikov, wearing the other mask of the pair, is cowering behind one of the chairs of the nearest table.)

If the players do not interrupt, Danika scolds the boys as follows:

* Danika sharply (though not unkindly) addresses Brom and Bray by their full names. Both children snap to attention.
* Danika asks the boys, "What did your father tell you about wearing those masks in the taproom?" Both boys remove their masks, flushed, and Brom says, sheepishly, "We're not supposed to do it."
* Danika then asks the boys, "And what did I tell you about running in the taproom?" The two are quiet, then Bray pipes up, "...we're not s'posed to do it?" Danika replies, "Exactly."

If the soup was spilled, Danika directs Bray to fetch a pail of water from **N2a. Well** outside, and Brom to fetch a mop from the kitchen to clean up the mess. If the soup wasn't spilled, Danika reminds the boys that they're supposed to be helping their father cook dinner, and shoos them into the kitchen.

In either case, Danika apologizes to the players and offers them free meals the following evening. If the players ask about Brom and Bray, Danika smiles fondly and says, "They can be a handful sometimes, but they're good boys."

If the players ask about the children's masks, Danika tells them that Urwin bought them from the local toymaker, Gadolf Blinsky, who works at **N7. Blinsky Toys** (p.118).

##### The Brothers Wachter

As the players eat their dinner, Nikolai and Karl Wachter enter the taproom, obviously at least somewhat drunk. (The two are as described in **N2c. Taproom** (p. 100).)

Slightly slurring his words, Nikolai announces to the bar, "My fellow Vallakians! All is not well!" The room abruptly becomes quiet and tense. If the players do not interrupt, a beat later, Karl steps forward, leaning on his brother, and booms, "...at least, not until I've got a bellyfull of wine!" A tense, humorless chuckle rolls through the taproom, and the other patrons return to their business.

Karl and Nikolai then stumble toward the bar, where Danika is regarding them skeptically. If the players do not interrupt, they can overhear the following conversation:

* Danika greets Karl and Nikolai by name, and asks, "Haven't you already had too much to drink, boys?"
* Nikolai waves away her words and says, "Nonsense—we've only begun! Two pints of wine to start, and keep them coming." 
* Danika replies, "We're starting to run a bit low on some of our vintage stock—can I start you with some Purple Grapemash No. 3?" Nikolai scoffs and says, "What do you take us for—tasteless peasants? Red Dragon Crush, and don't be stingy."
* As she pours their wine, Danika says idly, "Does your mother know what you're up to this evening?" Karl waits until he receives his pint, then grunts, "Mother's far too busy these days. And what she doesn't know can't hurt her." ("Or us," Nikolai charms in, elbowing his brother. The two chuckle, then return to their drinks.)

Shortly after the Wachter brothers arrive, Urwin exits the kitchen carrying a tray of food, which he sets down at a nearby table. On his way back to the kitchen, he stops at the players' table and asks their opinions on the food.


\pagebreakNum

If the players ask about the Wachter brothers, Urwin can tell them the information listed in **N2c. Taproom** (p. 100). If the players ask about their mother, or about the response to Nikolai's declaration that "All is not well," Urwin becomes visibly uneasy, and promises to speak with the players further in the morning.

If the players speak with the Wachter brothers, Nikolai and Karl are wary at first, but happy (if prodded) to rant about:

* the Festival of the Blazing Sun, 
* Vallaki's recent history of festivals, 
* the Baron's response to those who speak ill of the festivals, and 
* the flashes of purple light that have been seen from the attic of **N3. Burgomaster's Mansion**

(See **Vallaki Lore** (p. 96)). Once the players have won the brothers' trust, the conversation proceeds as described in **N2c. Taproom**.

##### The Ringmaster Arrives

Soon after the Wachter brothers receive their drinks, Rictavio arrives, entering the taproom through the front door. He is largely as described in **Rictavio** (p. 238) and **N2c. Taproom** (p. 100).

Though Rictavio appears to be headed for the stairs leading to **N2j. Great Balcony**, Nikolai and Karl catch sight of him and begin to hoot and holler in his direction, calling, "It's the carnival-man! Tell us a story, carnival-man!" (As they do, the players can see Brom and Bray standing beside the bar, helping Danika wipe some glasses dry.) A few patrons around the bar pick up the cry, and Rictavio turns, flourishing his cape, and beams, vowing, "Who would Rictavio be if he did not quench his fans' thirst for revelry?"

Unless interrupted, Rictavio then leaps halfway up the staircase leading from the taproom to **N2j. Great Balcony**, where he delivers the following tale:

<div class="descriptive">

I was making my way through the forest on Drusilla, my trusty steed, along with my coterie of carnival companions, when I heard something carried to me on an errant breeze. A voice it was, singing a melody so beautiful it brought a tear to my eye. But the voice was more than merely beautiful.

I couldn't help but follow the sound, leading Drusilla deeper into the woods. And soon enough, I found the source of the singing. There, before my very eyes, was a plant quite unlike anything I had ever seen. It was gigantic, towering high above me with a mouth that could swallow a grown man whole. And yet, there it was, singing with a voice that could fill an angelic choir with jealousy.

By all the gods, I could not believe my luck. A singing plant! This was just the kind of oddity I had been looking for. I approached it, trying to get a better look at it. That's when I saw one of my companions from the carnival—a man by the name of Wilfred—approaching the plant with a mischievous grin on his face.

"What are you doing, Wilfred?" I asked, to which he laughed and replied, "I'm going to give this plant a taste of what it's been missing." Before I could stop him, Wilfred dropped his trousers and began to, ah, "water the bushes"—right on the plant's stalk.

Well, let me tell you, that was not the wisest move on Wilfred's part. The plant, it seems, was not amused. It opened its giant mouth and, with one swift movement, swallowed Wilfred whole. There was a moment of stunned silence, and then the plant continued to sing as if nothing had happened.

Despite what I had just seen, I couldn't help but burst out laughing at the absurdity of it all. And as I looked around at my carnival members, their faces a mixture of shock and disbelief, I knew: This singing, man-eating plant would be the star of our next show.

And so it was. "Ladies and gentlemen," I announced not long thereafter, curtain rope in hand. "It is with equal parts caution and excitement that I present to you, the singing carnivorous plant! And do remember, folks—keep your distance, and try not to pour out any libations on it, lest *you* wind up on the menu."

The carnival erupted in giddy laughter and applause. In a moment, I knew that this would be one of our greatest hits. And, as for poor Wilfred—well, I suppose he'll be singing in a different kind of choir now.

</div>

The patrons of the inn burst into laughter and applause—a welcome respite from the previous dreary mood. Rictavio takes another flourishing bow and excuses himself, retiring for the night to **N2n Private Guest Room**.

\pagebreakNum

Any player who watches as Rictavio makes his way along **N2j. Great Balcony** sees him pass Brom and Bray, who are crouched along the balcony in front of **N2o. Boys' Bedroom**. (The boys are dangling the stuffed bat described in **N2o. Boys' Bedroom** (p. 102) over the bar below, giggling while Nikolai and Karl drunkenly swat at it. The boys used the **N2i. Secret Stairs and Hall** (p. 101) to scamper quietly from the kitchen to the balcony during Rictavio's tale, unseen by the inn's patrons.)

<blockquote>

<h5>Profile: Rictavio</h5>

**Roleplaying Information**

***Resonance.*** Rictavio should inspire amusement for his flamboyant dress, his ringmaster’s extravagance, and his colorful manner of speech, which most often includes referring to himself in the third person.

***Emotions.*** To onlookers, Rictavio most often appears to feel amused, delighted, or satisfied.

***Motivations.*** Rictavio wants to maintain his reputation as an amusing, though somewhat outrageous carnival ringmaster.

***Inspirations.*** When planning Rictavio, channel Varrick (*Avatar: The Legend of Korra*) or a stereotypical carnival barker.

<span style="height: 2px;">&nbsp;</span>

**Character Information**

***Persona.*** To the world, Rictavio appears as a flamboyant, irreverent, and occasionally narcissistic carnival ringmaster.

***Morale.*** In a fight, Rictavio would attempt to fast-talk his way out of trouble, fleeing from battle if hostilities seem unavoidable. (He might, however, step in to defend an innocent from harm at the hands of the supernatural—though doing his best to preserve his secret identity.)

***Relationships.*** Rictavio is secretly Dr. Rudolph van Richten, the famed vampire hunter.

</blockquote>

##### End of the Evening

The taproom slowly clears out over the following two hours. If the players rented rooms for the night, Danika eventually approaches their table and offers to show them to their rooms. (See **N2l. Guest Rooms** and **N2m. Guest Room** (p. 102)). During the tour, Danika lets them know that they're free to request fresh linens or a tub of hot water (for a bath) be brought up to their rooms. "Breakfast is served an hour after sunrise," she says warmly, and adds, "Feel free to let us know if you need anything else."

***Milestone.*** Arriving in Vallaki completes a story milestone. When the party takes its first long rest in Vallaki, award each player 900 XP, plus an additional 100 XP if they successfully escorted Ireena to Vallaki. (The players don't need to bring Ireena to St. Andral's church to receive this XP.)

#### B4c. Morning in Vallaki

##### Urwin's Advice

When the players next awaken in the Blue Water Inn, Urwin knocks on their door and asks to speak with them.

After exchanging pleasantries, Urwin warns the players that they must be cautious in Vallaki—both due to the town's harsh system of law enforcement and recent political tensions. Urwin can share the following additional information, as described in **Vallaki Lore** (p. 96):

* The date of the Festival of the Blazing Sun,
* Vallaki's recent history of festivals,
* The Baron's strict rules regarding his festivals—and the fates of those who speak ill of them,
* The brutish nature of [[Izek Strazni]], the baron's henchman,

If the players ask whether the Baron has any enemies in Vallaki, Urwin can also share the information about Lady Fiona Wachter described in **Vallaki Lore** (p. 96).

##### Exiting the Inn

As the players exit the Blue Water Inn on their first morning in Vallaki, they find the street full of townsfolk. Assuming the players do not interfere, the following scene then unfolds:

* The players hear the sound of a whinnying horse from down the street—and the townsfolk freeze and fall silent. As the players look toward the south, they can see a small procession: Baron Vargas Vallakovich (as described in **Roleplaying the Vallakovich Family**, p. 105) riding upon his chestnut horse, flanked by his two **mastiffs** and followed by three **guards**. [[Izek Strazni]] leads the procession. (The horse is named Frolic, and the two mastiffs are named Claw and Fang.)
* The players can see that an old, frightened-looking woman wearing threadbare commoner’s clothes has just stumbled away from the horse and fallen into a puddle of mud a few feet away from the horse. The horse has come to an abrupt halt, and the procession has stopped along with it. Izek’s devilish arm is outstretched, suggesting that he has just pushed—or flung—the old woman into the mud. (The woman is Willemina Rikalova, the mother of the imprisoned shoemaker Udo Lukovich.)
* The Baron angrily scolds the woman for getting mud on his cloak with her “filthy peasant’s hands.” The old woman, her voice quavering, apologizes and pleads with the Baron to release her son, Udo, claiming that he meant no harm with his “foolish joke.” 
* The Baron insists that Udo needs “rehabilitation” for his “malicious unhappiness,” and suggests that the woman does as well. He commands Izek to seize her and lock her in the stocks, suggesting that “a few days in the stocks ought to tighten her tongue.” Izek steps forward, flexing his devilish arm with a cruel glint in his eye. 
* Izek grabs the woman, hauls her to her feet, and thrusts her rudely into the guards’ waiting arms. Two of the guards pull the old woman’s arms behind her back and begin to pull her south as she struggles, weeps, and pleads for her son’s freedom. No townsfolk dare to help her. 
* As the old woman is hauled away, the Baron turns to the townsfolk surrounding him and announces: “Let that be a lesson as to the dangers of malicious unhappiness! The Devil’s hand is long, but our joy shall overcome his shadow.”

If the players interrupt Willemina’s arrest, the Baron greets them as outsiders and asks, with amusement, whether they seek to claim responsibility for the “old fool’s” rehabilitation themselves. 

***Diplomacy.*** If the players make a successful DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check or make an argument that sufficiently flatters the Baron’s ego, he directs the guards to release her into their custody. He welcomes them to Vallaki and pompously commands them to ensure that they educate themselves as to the town’s rules and traditions. 

***Hostility.*** If the players indicate a willingness to start a fight, the Baron’s eyes narrow and his mastiffs begin to growl. Meanwhile, Izek’s arm burns with a crimson flame, his grip tightening around the haft of his silvered battleaxe. 

The Baron first demands to know whether the players are “spies of the Devil Strahd.” The players can attempt to calm the situation and secure Willemina’s arrest peacefully, but any subsequent Charisma checks made to sway the Baron are made with disadvantage.

If it appears that combat is imminent, Father Lucian Petrovich (as described in *N1. St. Andral's Church**, p. 97) steps forth from the crowd and urges peace. The Baron greets him warmly by name, and Father Petrovich apologizes for Willemina’s behavior, noting that she has been troubled in recent days at his congregations. He promises to escort her to St. Andral’s Church and see that her troubled mind is eased—a proposition that the Baron reluctantly accepts. 

The Baron also wonders aloud whether he should punish the players for their insolence. Father Petrovich assures the Baron that they are merely outsiders, untaught in Vallaki’s ways, and that he shall see to it that they are properly educated. The Baron imperiously orders that he see to it, then informs the players that they have caught him “in a good mood,” and that they should be grateful for “the Morninglord’s mercy.” He warns them, however, that future lawbreaking shall be met with harsh punishments.

***Departure.*** As the Baron departs the scene, he announces to the crowd: “I shall expect to see you all at the Festival of the Blazing Sun three days hence. All will be well!”

The townsfolk, bearing smiles that better resemble grimaces, grimly intone, “All will be well.” The Baron nods, evidently satisfied, and continues riding north, followed by Izek, his mastiffs, and any remaining guards. The activity of the street resumes shortly thereafter.

If Ireena is with the party, she has drawn up the cloak of her hood upon exiting the inn. Nonetheless, unless the party has taken specific action to prevent Izek from noticing her, he catches Ireena’s eye and holds her gaze for a long, lingering moment before ultimately departing, leaving Ireena feeling uncomfortable and cold. ***Arc G: The Strazni Siblings** then begins. (If asked, Ireena notes with uncertainty that something about Izek seemed almost familiar, though she can’t remember why.)

If the players defied Vargas or Izek in any way, or otherwise assisted Willemina, Ernst Larnak reports their actions to Lady Fiona Wachter at Wachterhaus. ***Arc F: Lady Wachter’s Wish*** then begins.

***End of an Act.*** When the players set off from the Blue Water Inn for their first full day in Vallaki, **Act I** ends and **Act II** begins.
