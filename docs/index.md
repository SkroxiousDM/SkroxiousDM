# Obsidian Notes

Hey I'm SkroxiousDM, here in this collection of pages are a bunch of Homebrew rules i use in my 5e games

this is also the repository for my latest campaign Dragna Carta's Curse of Strahd Re-Reloaded [[https://www.strahdreloaded.com/]]

I'm using a modified version of Free League's "Ruins of Symbaroum" for charcter classes, wherin i've compressed the original 20 levels into 10.
