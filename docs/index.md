Hey I'm SkroxiousDM, here in this collection of pages are a bunch of Homebrew rules I use in my 5e games.

This is also the repository for my latest campaign [DragnaCarta's Curse of Strahd Re-Reloaded](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/) <br/>
MonD'n'Day Crew stay out of the link above.<br/>

I'm using a modified version of [Free League's "Ruins of Symbaroum"](https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/317720/ruins-of-symbaroum-5e-the-promised-land) for character classes, wherein I've compressed the original 20 levels into 10.
