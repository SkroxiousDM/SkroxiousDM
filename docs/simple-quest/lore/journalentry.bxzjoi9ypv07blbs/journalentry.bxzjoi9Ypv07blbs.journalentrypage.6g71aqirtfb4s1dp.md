# Rahadin's Letter
To my esteemed lord and master,

Nearly five centuries past, I forswore my loyalty to a prince that knew only weakness, and instead swore an oath of allegiance to a king that embraced only strength—your father, the beloved King Barov. It was my highest honor to serve at his side, matched only by the honor I felt when he adopted me as his own.

Though King Barov has departed us, his legacy lives on in you—a legacy that burns fiercer than his Brightblade ever did. You have become the sun to his candle; the mount to his hill. By your hand, his great work was completed and wrought anew.

It has been my pride and honor to serve you, even as you undertook your journey beyond the veil of life itself. I do not regret the blood I have spilled, nor the lives I have taken, comforted in the knowledge that all has been in your name.

It is my one regret that this body is not as yours, and that when my heart shall cease to beat, so too shall my spirit depart my flesh. It is for this reason, however, that I am, and shall forever be, grateful for the opportunity you have granted me to serve you one final time. Though my eyes shall not see the glory of your rise from the ashes, I have seen it in my heart, and that is enough.

May your reign be great and terrible, and may your throne never end.

Your eternal and obedient servant, </br> 
Rahadin von Zarovich
