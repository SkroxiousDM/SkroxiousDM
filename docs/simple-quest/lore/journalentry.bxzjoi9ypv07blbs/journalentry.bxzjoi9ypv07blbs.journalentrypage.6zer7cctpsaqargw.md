# Oaktree Letter
Dearest Varushka,

I hope this letter finds you well, though I fear it may not. My heart aches as I pen these words, knowing they may be the last I ever write you.

I pray that you too survived the slaughter. Please forgive my cowardice—though I fled for my life, some part of me also knew I had fled from the life we may once have shared together. If you are reading this letter, then my spirit is gladdened to know that you have also escaped safely. My heart breaks, however, to share that we shall never again meet in this life.

I have been given—and accepted—an offer of a new future, and a new opportunity. I do this not to abandon you, but because I am convinced that there is no other way to set things right. You always said that nothing is ever too broken to repair. As I stand at this crossroads, I cling to my hope that you were right.

Some time ago, you gave me a gift—one that I cannot take with me on this new journey. I have left it atop our tree, watched by a pair of guardians provided by my new benefactor. Please take it with my deepest regrets and my warmest wishes. No soul deserves love and peace more than you.

May you live a long and happy life, and may joy follow evermore in your footsteps, even in the nights of darkest sorrow.

Sincerely and forever yours,

Katarina
