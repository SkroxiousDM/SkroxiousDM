# Silver Tablet
#### I solemnly vow to uphold the virtues of the Order of the Silver Dragon, with honor as my shield and truth as my guide.<br>In the shadow of evil, I shall be the light; in the face of despair, the beacon of hope. No challenge shall shake my resolve; no defeat shall quell my heart. With sword and spirit, I shall stand against darkness and forge a brighter dawn.<br>So do I swear in the name of the Silver Dragon, from this to the end of days.
