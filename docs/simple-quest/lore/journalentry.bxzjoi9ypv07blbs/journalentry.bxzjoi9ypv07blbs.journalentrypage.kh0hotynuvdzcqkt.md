Let them tell their stories of dark triumph against the protector of the Balinok Mountains! Let Argynvost be remembered as a dragon of honor and valor.

I do not fear death. I have laid down my trappings beneath the tower's watchful gaze, so that others may carry my legacy in my stead. Though my body will die, my spirit will live on where the oath and fire of the Silver Dragon survive. Let it serve as a beacon of light against the darkness. Let it bring hope to a land fraught with despair.

Now, to battle!
