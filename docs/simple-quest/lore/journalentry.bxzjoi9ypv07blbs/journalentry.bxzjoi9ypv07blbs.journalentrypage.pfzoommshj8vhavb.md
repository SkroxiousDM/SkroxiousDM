# The Oath Celestial
the book has been partially burned, and its cover was slashed by a sword. Leafing through the crumbling book reveals that it is a devotional text for knights from a place called the Holy Empire of Valentia.

A simple leather bookmark engraved with the sigil of the Morninglord—a rising sun—marks the place of a passage within the book titled Prayer for the Departed. It reads as follows:

***Blessed Morninglord, bringer of dawn, we honor those who have journeyed beyond into your kingdom of everlasting radiance. In your light, grant them peace, from this until the end of days.***
