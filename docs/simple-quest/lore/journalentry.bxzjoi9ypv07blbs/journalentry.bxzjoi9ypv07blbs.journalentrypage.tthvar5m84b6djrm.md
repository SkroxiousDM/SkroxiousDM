# St. Andral's Letter
![Saint Andral's Letter by Caleb Cleveland](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/7db64b11c71d88572ddc6cd06b888976/images/Andral_Scroll_RRL.jpg)

To Lord Argynvost, Protector of the Balinok Mountains and Founder of the Order of the Silver Dragon,

You have stood as a bulwark against the darknessâ€”a shining example of righteousness and courage. Yet I write to you today with a heavy heart and a burdened soul, fearful that Markovia's counsel will lead your Order down a path that ends in darkness and devastation.

I confess that Lord Von Zarovich is imperfect, as all men inevitably are. Yet his leadership has brought stability and order to a land fraught with chaos, and restored songs of prayer to halls once consigned to madness.

It is therefore with great humility and respect that I implore you and your knights to lay down their arms and make peace. Further bloodshed will tear this land asunder, bringing suffering to the innocent and guilty alike. But with the aid of your wisdom and grace, I do not doubt that we may together forge a brighter dawn.

Faithfully yours,

Andral
