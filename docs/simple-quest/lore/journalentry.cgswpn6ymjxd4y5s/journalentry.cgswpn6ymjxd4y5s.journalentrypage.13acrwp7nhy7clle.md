# Arrigal
![](tokenizer\cos_tokens\arrigal.webp)

Arrigal is grateful for the players’ assistance in recovering his niece. He is glad to promise that, notwithstanding his oath of loyalty to Strahd, he will refrain from reporting Arabelle or Van Richten’s true locations to Castle Ravenloft, and will avoid reporting the players’ movements for as long as he can.

In addition, though he won’t take up arms against Strahd or cease his work as a spy, Arrigal offers to deliver false information to Castle Ravenloft once when the players request it—but no more than that. He won’t deliver any information that is obviously false, however, and he provides no guarantees as to how long or whether Strahd will believe his information.


#### Relationships. 
Arrigal is @LORE[.tsPEAozsPr968wfU]{Luvash}’s younger brother and @LORE[.VZhIrUIKNNw4b2ck]{Arabelle}’s uncle.
