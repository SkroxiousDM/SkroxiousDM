# Gadof Blinsky
![](tokenizer\cos_tokens\blinski.webp)

Gadof Blinsky is a cheerful toymaker with a love for the macabre


Blinsky owns Piccolo, a pet monkey that was given to him by "Alanik Ray", a traveling scholar (and one of Rudolph van Richten's disguises) shortly after Doru's rebellion. Blinsky also makes dolls resembling Ireena Kolyana for Izek Strazni, and receives a humble stipend to craft decorations for Baron Vallakovichâ€™s weekly festivals. In addition, Blinsky is the creator of Ezmerelda d'Avenir's prosthetic leg.
