- She is an herbalist who lives in the woods nearby with her husband, Kiril.
- She saw Ezmerelda’s wagon and was curious about its contents. Rather than open the door, she investigated further and found the trapdoor on its bottom, which she used to enter and explore its interior.
- She took the lyre and perfume because they reminded her of memories she had from long ago—"from before I met my husband." She took the scrolls because she has always been fascinated by books, but was disappointed when she proved unable to decipher them.

<p dir="auto">Hear, O stars, my yearning plea,
<br>To feel his arms upon me.
<br>
<br>Lost beneath the starlit sea,
<br>His light it waits, haunting me
<br>Draw his whispers close to me,
<br>That in his shade, I might see
<br>
<br>Heed, heed his call.
<br>Ooh.</p>
<p dir="auto">Near enough, his amber eye gleams
<br>My feet betray the better of me
<br>A silver-lit path that wanders my dreams
<br>His shadowed gaze shall guide me
<br>
<br>Ever on.
<br>
<br>Run
<br>Leap
<br>Still he flees
<br>But now the sky's around us
<br>We're soaring
<br>Falling
<br>
<br>Don't look down
<br>Don't look down
<br>Don't look down
<br>Don't look down
<br>Don't look down</p>

- The song she was singing is titled “The Lunatic’s Lament," and is about a woman who falls in love with the moon and chases it off a cliff, ultimately falling to her death. After pausing for a moment, she adds, softly: "Have you ever fallen in love with someone, and wondered if you made a mistake?"

- Thirteen years ago, Bianca was the daughter of a wealthy family. She forfeited her inheritance, however, when she fell in love with a brawny and strapping young logger named Kiril Stoyanovich. Against her parents' wishes, she fled from her comfortable life to live with him in a cottage in the nearby woods.
- While "the vampire" slept, the wilds were more peaceful—but ever since Strahd awoke, Kiril has been "haunted—not by any ghost, but by his own rage."
- "Every week, that . . . rage seems to devour ever-more of him," she adds quietly. "I don't know how much of the man I married is still left inside."
