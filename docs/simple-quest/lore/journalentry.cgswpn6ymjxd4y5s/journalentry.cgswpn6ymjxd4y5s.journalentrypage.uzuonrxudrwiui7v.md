# Arturi
![](tokenizer\cos_tokens\Arturi.webp)

- Arturi notes quietly that Van Richten is an acquaintance of his, and that he had recently heard a rumor that he had been seen traveling to Barovia.

-When the game ends, Arturi bids the players farewell and departs from the camp. If asked why, he shares, with a sad smile, that the camp is in danger each moment he lingers there after dark. "I have been selfish tonight," he murmurs, "and pushed my fortunes as far as I dare. But I dare not remain any longer, for fear of the terror that might follow."

- the undead pursue him wherever he goes, and that they have haunted him each night for the past eighteen years. "A man once vowed that undead shall take me," he says. "And although they have not yet succeeded, they have never failed to try." He declines to explain further, asserting sadly: "Some tales wound the teller. Please, ask no more."
