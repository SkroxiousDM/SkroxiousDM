#### Relationships. 
Victor is the only child of @LORE[.b7BD4rO3tPUEmCHX]{Baron Vargas Vallakovich} (whom he dislikes) and @LORE[.bOnugMEPLeUZFWpa]{Baroness Lydia Petrovna} (whom he cares for, but finds irritating). He is a close friend to @LORE[.NKJ40e9yPJv4MK3O]{Stella Wachter}, and a friendly (though wary) acquaintance to the ghost of @LORE[.ZwDC8k5NZ7GrvgxV]{Erasmus}. Victor despises and fears @LORE[.gmmNPx22ZWqsIR7m]{Izek Strazni}, who killed Victor’s childhood cat, Murka, by kicking it across a room when it wandered into his path two years ago. (Victor has since reanimated Murka’s skeleton through the use of his animate dead spell.)
