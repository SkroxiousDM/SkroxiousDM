# Erasmus Van Richten
![Erasmus](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/7db64b11c71d88572ddc6cd06b888976/images/Erasmus.png)

The spectral silhouette grows in brightness and definition until it assumes a more solidified shape: the ethereal form of a ghostly young man. He appears to be no more than fourteen, his form shimmering with a warm, inviting light that seems to soften the gray monotone of his surroundings.

He wears short pants, a loose shirt, and a vest, though his body becomes wisps of curling fog not far below his knees. His eyes glitter with mirth, and an elfin smile plays across his face as his unkempt hair drifts lazily amidst the gloom. When he speaks, his voice is cheery and light, and his fingers twitch with excitement.
