# Holy Symbol of Ravenkind
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a creature of good alignment)

The holy symbol has 5 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d4 + 1 charges daily at dawn.

**Dawn's Embrace**. As a reaction, when a creature you can see within 30 feet of you would be reduced to 0 hit points, you can expend 2 charges to cause that creature to drop to 1 hit point instead. That creature gains immunity to all damage until the start of its next turn.

**Light of Hope**. As an action, you can expend 1 charge and choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. All of the following conditions on that creature end: blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, paralyzed, poisoned, and stunned.

**Sunâ€™s Blessing**. As an action, you can expend 2 charges to cause holy power to radiate from the symbol in a 30-foot radius for 1 minute. Nonhostile creatures in that radius deal an extra 1d4 radiant damage when they hit with a weapon attack.

You can also use the holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your Theurg spells. You gain a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls and to the saving throw DCs of your Theurg spells.
