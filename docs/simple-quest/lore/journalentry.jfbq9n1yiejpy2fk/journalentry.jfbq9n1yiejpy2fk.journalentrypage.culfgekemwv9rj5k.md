# Amber Shard
scrutinizes an amber shard with a detect magic spell discerns tinges of abjuration magic. A player who attempts to identify a shard with an identify spell learns that it was once a part of a larger framework meant to contain or imprison some entity or creature, and that it still retains some arcane link to the original container.
