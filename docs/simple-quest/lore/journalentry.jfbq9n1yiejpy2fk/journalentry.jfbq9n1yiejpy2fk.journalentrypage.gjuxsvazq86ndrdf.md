# Furtive Firestarter
Wondrous item, uncommon

This finely crafted set of flint and steel bears small runes etched along the sides of both pieces. When the set is used to ignite a combustible material, the resulting flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius, sheds no dim light, and produces no smoke. While within thirty feet of a flame created in this way, the user can speak a command word to instantly extinguish the flame.
