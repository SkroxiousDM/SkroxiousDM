# Amulet of Knight’s Passage
*A small block of white stone, bears the carving of a dragon’s head and is mounted on a leather cord.*

This carved block of white stone is a key that allows passage through the gatehouse at Tsolenka Pass. If a creature presents the stone to the T3. Curtain of Green Flame (p. 157), the curtain is suppressed for 1 minute. While the curtain is suppressed in this way, the petrified vrocks described in T2. Demon Statues (p. 157) don’t animate or attack.

The scrutiny of an identify spell reveals only that the block is a key of some kind, though not what for.
