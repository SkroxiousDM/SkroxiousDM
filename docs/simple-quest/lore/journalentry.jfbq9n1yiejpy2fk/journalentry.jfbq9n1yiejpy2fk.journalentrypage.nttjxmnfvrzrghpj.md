# Twilight Crest
![twilight Crest](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/7db64b11c71d88572ddc6cd06b888976/images/Twilight_Crest.png)Uncommon wondrous item (requires attunement)

This small medallion is carved from petrified wood and dotted with tiny gleaming clusters of azurite. From dawn until dusk, the azurite is colored a deep blue. From dusk until dawn, the azure is instead a dark, vivid purple.

The crest has 3 charges, and regains 1 charge at dawn. 

During the day, the crest's wielder can spend 1 charge as an action to cast aid.

At night, the crest's wielder can spend 1 charge as an action to cast spirit guardians (save DC 15). When cast in this way, the guardians take the form of shadowy, ash-like moths, and the spell deals only necrotic damage.

The wielder can spend all 3 charges as an action at any time of day to cast enervation (save DC 15). If they do, the crest doesnâ€™t regain charges for the next three dawns.
