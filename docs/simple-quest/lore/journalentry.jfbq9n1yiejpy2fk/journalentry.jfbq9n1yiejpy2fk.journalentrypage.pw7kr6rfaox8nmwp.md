# Chest of Holding
A finely carved wooden chest has been wrapped in a bright red ribbon and left upon one of the cushioned seats inside the carriage. The chest, which is locked and approximately one foot across and six inches deep, radiates an aura of conjuration magic under the scrutiny of a detect magic spell. The chest has the properties of a 

<details>
  <summary>bag of holding</summary>

This bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions—roughly 2 feet square and 4 feet deep on the inside. The bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires a Utilize action.

If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. The bag holds enough air for 10 minutes of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.

Placing a Bag of Holding inside an extradimensional space created by a Heward’s Handy Haversack, Portable Hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way and can’t be reopened.

 but only if opened in the correct way. (Despite its rigid appearance, if opened correctly, the box's mouth expands to fit any item placed inside of it, so long as that item fits within the box's internal volume. The box shrinks back to its original size once the item is fully within the box.)

The front of the chest bears a carved sliding puzzle composed of eight slidable wooden panels and a ninth empty space in the center of the puzzle. Each panel is carved with a different animal. When the players first inspect it, the rows of the puzzle read as follows from top to bottom: bat, rat, elk; wolf, empty space, bear; spider, raven, butterfly.

The following poem is carved upon the top of the chest in beautiful calligraphy:

***My lips I nightly lift toward the silver moon,<br>
With trembling strings I weave upon my tiny loom,<br>
On wings of ink I glide above the sulking gloom.***

***Scuttling through the shadows, in darkness I confide,<br>
With daylight's fragile beauty upon my lying eyes,<br>
Silent in the cavern's womb, with naught but stars to guide.***

***I seek majesty in solitude,<br>
I have no truths to hide,<br>
My crown yet sits upon my head for all to see with pride.***

The poem is a hint as to the proper order of the panels: wolf, spider, raven; rat, butterfly, bat; bear, empty space, elk. If the panels are arranged in the proper order, the chest opens, allowing access to the extradimensional storage space within. When first opened in this way, the chest contains a number of neatly wrapped parcels equal to the number of players. Each parcel contains a set of fine black velvet gloves with silver trim and a fine black velvet cloak lined with wolf fur.
