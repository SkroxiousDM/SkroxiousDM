# Keeper's Whistle
![Keepers Whistle](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/7db64b11c71d88572ddc6cd06b888976/images/Keepers_Whistle.png)
The whistle is a magic item tied to the curse of wereraven lycanthropy. Once per day, the players can blow the whistle to summon the nearest wereraven agent of the Keepers of the Feather within five miles (if any). (The agent takes a reasonable amount of time to arrive, flying from its current location to the location where the players blew the whistle.)

When the agent arrives (in raven form), the players can ask that the agent do one of the following tasks, within reason:

Scout out a nearby environment, providing information on enemy numbers, traps, or layout. (The agent won’t get too close if the area is potentially dangerous, preferring to survey it from a distance.)
Deliver an item or message (either oral or written) to another creature in Barovia, assuming the agent knows of or can find that creature.
Obtain a small, light item from a nearby location or settlement, so long as it can be easily found, purchased, or otherwise retrieved.
Distract one or more nearby enemies (e.g., by using its mimicry ability). (The agent won’t put itself at risk of being grappled, and is wary of approaching any ranged combatants unless reassured that they wield neither silver weapons nor magic spells.)
Spy on a location or character, tailing them discreetly and reporting back on their activities and associations after a predetermined period of time. (The agent won’t enter any structures while doing so.)
The agent departs after completing the requested task.
