# Spirit Mirror
Wondrous item, rare

In addition to its current plane, this ornate bronze mirror also reflects the corresponding location in the Ethereal Plane out to a distance of 60 feet.

Once per day, you can use an action to cause it to either shrink to the size of a hand mirror or grow to the size of a full-length mirror.
