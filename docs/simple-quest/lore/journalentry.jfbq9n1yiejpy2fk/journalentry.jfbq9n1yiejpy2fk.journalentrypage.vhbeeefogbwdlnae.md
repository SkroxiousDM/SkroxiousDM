# Bracelet of Warding
*a silver bracelet carved to resemble a dragon biting its own tail*

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)

This bracelet has 3 charges. While wearing it, you can use a bonus action to spend 1 of its charges to cast the sanctuary spell (DC 15), or 2 of its charges to cast the warding bond spell with a range of 30 feet.

You can cast one of these spells as a reaction in response to an enemy attacking a creature within range. If you do, you must spend an additional charge, and the spell must target the attacked creature. When cast in this way, the spell's effects end at the start of your next turn.

The bracelet regains 1 expended charge daily at dawn. If you expend the bracelet's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the bracelet loses its magical properties.
