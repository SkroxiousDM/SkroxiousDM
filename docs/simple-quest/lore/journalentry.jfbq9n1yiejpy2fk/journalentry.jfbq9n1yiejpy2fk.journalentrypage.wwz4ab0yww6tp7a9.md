# Talisman of Echoes
![Talisman of Echoes](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/7db64b11c71d88572ddc6cd06b888976/images/SpeakWithDead.png)
Wondrous item, rare

This talisman has 4 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to spend 1 of its charges to cast the gentle repose spell, or 2 of its charges to cast the speak with dead spell. (The spell speak with dead isn't affected by the spell's ordinary ten-day limit when cast in this way.)

The talisman regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the talisman's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the talisman crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
