# motes of the Whispering Wall
"As promised," Strahd says, "your reward." He touches the spark to the edge of the Whispering Wall, and then draws it back toward him. As he does so, several tendrils of mist extrude from the Wall and condense into small gemstones which hover in the air. The number of gemstones is equal to the number of players in the party, and each gemstone is no larger than a fingernail. Half of the gemstones (rounded up) are gray, and half of the gemstones (rounded down) are silver.

Strahd then presents the gemstones to the players, allowing them to choose which they take. He can share only that a gray gemstone will lead its bearer to an object of their desire, and that a silver gemstones will take their bearer to a place they wish to go. "They are, of course, not the most powerful artifacts," Strahd notes. "The Wall is the product of a dead god, after all."

***A creature can crush a gray gemstone of desire as an action to cast locate object. A creature can crush a silver gemstone of desire as a bonus action to cast misty step.***
