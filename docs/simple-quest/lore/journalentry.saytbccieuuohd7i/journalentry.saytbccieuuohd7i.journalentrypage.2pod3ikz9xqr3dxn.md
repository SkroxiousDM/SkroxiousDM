# Strahd on the Whispering Wall
the Whispering Wall, the ancestors of the Forest Folk believed it to be the corpse or tomb of an ancient god, whose last exhalation of divinity produced this mist.

Strahd informs the players that these ancestors believed the Wall to offer visions of one's deepest desires, if one entered it as a pilgrim. "It is a powerful thing, to know oneself and one's desires," he says, adding softly. "and yet dangerous, as well." 

If asked whether he has stepped into the Wall himself, Strahd nods. If asked what he sees within the Wall, he shares that he sees a "white fortress above a great city, with a church bell ringing through the fog." 

Before giving the players their reward from winning Strahd's wager, Strahd asks them to complete one simple task: They must step into the Wall and view their deepest desires. "I will not ask what you see," Strahd promises. "One's desires are their own."

Strahd warns them, however, that many have become lost in the Whispering Wall, too entranced by its visions to depart. "It guides you forward, but you must leave under your own power," he says. "Remember: The way back will come but once."

Strahd promises that each player who enters the Wall and returns safely will receive an additional gift: a shard of the power of the Whispering Wall itself. (He won't say more than that.) He wonders aloud, however, whether they will have the strength of will to do so. "Lesser men often lose themselves to its illusions," he says, a taunting glint in his eye. "They trade life for dreams, and receive neither. They are lost to the mist, doomed to remain there for eternity."
