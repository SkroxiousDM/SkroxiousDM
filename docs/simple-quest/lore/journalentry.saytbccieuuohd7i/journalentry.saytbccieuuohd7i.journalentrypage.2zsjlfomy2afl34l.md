# Revenant on the Mountain Folk
the “First People" were split long ago in the face of tragedy and strife, and that their descendants remained apart ever since. It notes that the Forest Folk have embraced Strahd von Zarovich as their lord and ruler, but that the Mountain Folk still hold to the old ways, worshipping ancient goddesses that once dwelled in the valley. (The revenant doesn’t know where the Mountain Folk dwell, but has heard that their settlement is hidden somewhere in the mountains.)
