# The Abbot on St. Markovia
- Saint Markovia was of the same generation as Strahd von Zarovich—but where Strahd lived a life of steel and blood, Saint Markovia walked in grace beneath the light of the Morninglord.
- As a youth, Markovia followed her heart and became a priest of the Morninglord soon after her eighteenth birthday. She proved to be a charismatic proselytizer and, before the age of thirty, had gained a reputation for allowing no evil to stand before her.
- It was Tasha Petrovna, an oracle and cleric of the Morninglord, who, with the guidance of one of the Morninglord’s angels, elevated Saint Markovia as a new prophet of the Morninglord’s faith. Following internal strife with Saint Andral, the Most High Priest of the Morninglord’s church, however, Saint Markovia departed the Morninglord’s holy lands and built a new sanctuary in the quiet wilderness: the Abbey of Saint Markovia, which served as both a convent and hospital.
- Shortly after Strahd’s curse fell upon the valley, Saint Markovia gathered her followers and marched upon Castle Ravenloft. Strahd destroyed them all, and those who remained at the Abbey soon fell into madness and despair.
