# Doru and Donavich
- After the players departed the village of Barovia, Doru and Donavich reconciled and worked to repair the worst of the damage inflicted upon the Barovian church. The two have worked hard together in sessions of “meditation and prayer," and Donavich is proud of Doru’s “progress."
- After completing the church’s repairs and learning of Gertruda’s disappearance, Doru was anxious to try to find her. Determined to help his son and future daughter-in-law, Donavich ensured that the village had no further need of his healing services before setting off with Doru on the road to Vallaki, hoping to find Gertruda—or at least clues to her whereabouts or ultimate fate.
- The two spent the night at Tser Pool encampment two nights ago, then set off for Vallaki yesterday morning, arriving at Vallaki just before dusk. (If the players imply that Doru or Donavich had reason to fear the monsters of the Svalich Wood in making the trek, Doru smiles coldly and says, “I’d like to see them try.") Although Doru has repeatedly insisted that his father go ahead and find shelter, Donavich has stubbornly refused to leave Doru behind.
