# Muriel on the mountain and forest folk
the Mountain Folk—a tribe of hunter—gatherers that live amongst the Balinok Mountains—and that their people are neither servants of Strahd nor dangerous unless attacked. 

Muriel doesn’t know why the woman was watching the road, but shares that the Mountain Folk have been more active lately, though no one is quite sure why. Reports suggest that they’re looking for something, however. (If asked how she knows so much about the Mountain Folk, Muriel laughs and claims only that she’s well-traveled and has “many friends" across the valley.)

she shares that the Forest Folk are known to be loyal servants of Strahd, who they worship like a deity. She advises the players to steer clear of the druids’ lair: a terraced mound called Yester Hill in the southwest corner of the Svalich Woods, south of the Wizard of Wines.
