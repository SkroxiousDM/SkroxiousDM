# Master of Castle Ravenloft
<details>
<summary>Spoiler warning</summary>
- Displeased with the weakening of his rule while he had slept, Strahd summoned his minions to Castle Ravenloft and ordered them to restore his authority over the land. He also directed them to hunt down Dr. Van Richten, as described in Find Rudolph van Richten (p. 10). The castle’s servants, Lief Lipsiege and Cyrus Belview, proved grateful to finally have a proper lord to serve.

- Meanwhile, Strahd interrogated Rahadin to confirm the current date—and was relieved to learn that the time of the Grand Conjunction had not yet passed. Rahadin, knowledgeable of Strahd’s tells, inquired as to the reason behind Strahd’s concern—and Strahd shared with him the secrets of the Fanes, the Heart of Sorrow, and the coming Grand Conjunction.

- Their conversation was overheard, however, by the banshee of Patrina Velikovna, described further in Crypt 21 (Patrina Velikovna) (p. 89). Eager to seize Strahd’s power for herself, and seeing an opportunity to manipulate circumstances in her favor, Patrina contacted Kasimir in his dreams as described in Kasimir Velikov (p. 232) and K9a. Kasimir’s Hovel (p. 121).

- As his minions prepared to execute his bidding, Strahd gave Rahadin a critical task: announcing the Devil's return to Castle Ravenloft. Rahadin rode forth from the keep with haste and delivered his proclamation first to Barovia. As punishment for their treason, he told them, the village of Barovia alone would face Strahd's wrath, giving them ninety days to make peace with their gods.

- Rahadin rode next to Vallaki and Krezk, sharing the news of Strahd's reawakening. In response, a terrified Baron Vargas Vallakovich closed Vallaki's gates to outsiders, and began hosting weekly festivals in an effort to drive out the Devil's influence.

- Shortly after Rahadin's warning, many of the villagers of Barovia proposed an exodus to Vallaki, where they could take shelter behind the town's fortified walls. However, when Ismark Kolyanovich gave a rousing speech invoking the memory of Lugdana and Ismark the Great, most decided to remain in the village to defend their homes. Only a few Barovians—two dozen at most—gathered up their belongings and fled on the Old Svalich Road.

- Upon their arrival, however, Baron Vargas Vallakovich refused to allow the Barovian refugees entry, fearful that they were cursed by Strahd’s wrath. With news of the vampire’s return ringing in his ears, the Baron instead enacted a series of iron-fisted laws, clamping down on “malicious unhappiness” and mandating attendance at the “festivals” that he now considered the keys to Vallaki’s salvation.

- Not far away, in the village of Krezk, the Abbot felt Strahd’s return, and became determined to see the vampire’s curse lifted. (See The Abbot (p. 225).) The Abbot directed two of his attendants, the mongrelfolk Otto and Zygfrek Belview, to begin scouring the village’s cemeteries for human remains.

- Meanwhile, the darkness and despair spread by Strahd’s revival drew the attention of Morgantha, a night hag, and her two daughters, Bella Sunbane and Offalia Wormwiggle. The coven, drawn to Barovia like moths to a flame, took up residence in Chapter 6: Old Bonegrinder (p. 125) and began selling Dream Pastries (p. 125) to the Barovian refugees outside of Vallaki. Hoping to keep apprised of Castle Ravenloft’s doings, Morgantha bestowed her coven’s hag eye upon Cyrus Belview, as described in K62. Servants’ Hall (p. 76).

- Concerned that the Barovian werewolf pack had forgotten its ancient fealty to him, Strahd closed the valley's borders to them and sent dire wolf emissaries to confirm their loyalty once more. Emil Toranescu, the pack's alpha, privately schemed to betray Strahd's pact and escape through the mists—until Kiril Stoyanovich, a younger and more ambitious werewolf, betrayed him in turn. Strahd locked Emil in the castle dungeons, and Kiril took control of the pack in his stead.
