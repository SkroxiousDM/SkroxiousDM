##### ***The Vision***
 ~~-------------------------~~   
A rush of ethereal wind sweeps through the room—and a radiant burst of light erupts from the center of the pentagram, painting the walls in shades of silver and gold.<br>
Flashes of images flicker across your mind's eyes:<br>
+ A white-robed woman kneeling before a man with wings as white as the purest snow, who directs a gold-robed woman to present her with a silver statuette of a cleric kneeling in supplication, its chest glowing with the same golden light that encircles that man's head. [humility]<br>
+ The white-robed woman, standing before a half-built structure atop a cold mountain spur, her hands calloused as she lays bricks upon a mortared wall. [hope]<br>
+ The same woman, raising a golden mace above her head, a prayer upon her lips as a shadowed fortress looms above her. [defiance]
+ The silver statuette, sitting alone in a dark, cold tomb beneath a dark, twisted keep. The man, alone on a mountaintop, a veil of mist shrouding his eyes. [sorrow ]<br>
Each image is accompanied by a surge of emotion: humility, hope, defiance, and sorrow so strong it rakes at your chest with long, bitter claws. But as quickly as they appeared—the visions fade, and when you open your eyes again, you find the room returned to its former state. <br>
