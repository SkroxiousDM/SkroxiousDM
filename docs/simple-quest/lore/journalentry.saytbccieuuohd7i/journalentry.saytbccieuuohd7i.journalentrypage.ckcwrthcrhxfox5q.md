# Ireena's take on Doru's rebellion
- Doru was a friend of theirs, and the son of the village priest Father Donavich. He was a bright and cheery young man, with a sunny disposition and a zeal for everything he did.
- Just over three months ago, without warning, Doru announced a crusade against Castle Ravenloft, which he proclaimed would free Barovia from the mists and return sunlight to the valley. Over two dozen young Barovians accompanied him, as well as a scholar from distant lands named Alanik Ray, who had been staying as a guest at Ismark and Ireena's home for the previous several weeks while studying Barovian history and ecology.
- Ireena doesn't recall much about Alanik, other than that he was a curious, somewhat intense man who kept to himself, took long walks into the Svalich Woods, and owned a pet monkey. She does remember, however, that he had a furious argument with Doru at one point, which confused her when he accompanied Doru to Castle Ravenloft shortly thereafter.
