# Ilya on recent history
- Three weeks ago, a woman resembling Zuleika approached him at the Shrine of the White Sun in Krezk. She identified herself as Zuleika Krezkova, his long-absent aunt, and told him that his father was secretly a werewolf—and that his curse had passed to Ilya as well. (Zuleika has steadfastly denied doing so, and insists that someone imitated her appearance for their own purposes—a claim that Ilya has come to believe.)
- “Zuleika" told Ilya that his curse was a mighty weapon against Strahd von Zarovich and the servants of darkness, but warned him that his parents would soon attempt to suppress that “blessing" before it could emerge. She told him to refuse any potions of wolfsbane his parents attempted to feed him, then departed from Krezk.
- Ilya didn’t believe her, but soon changed his mind when his parents revealed the truth of his heritage mere days later. Determined to keep his family safe from Strahd and his minions, he secretly poured out the potion of wolfsbane his parents gave him before his mother locked him and his father away in their cottage’s secret basement.
- Ilya doesn’t remember what happened next. All he knows is that he awoke in a cage in the den the following morning, with blood staining his mouth. He’s been haunted ever since by the thought of those he may have harmed.
- Ilya blames the false “Zuleika" for his current predicament, and somewhat blames his parents for concealing the truth from him, but blames no one more than himself for the injuries he may have caused. Ilya doesn't blame the real Zuleika for his fate, and is deeply grateful to her for her reassurances and efforts to keep him comfortable.
