# Origins of The Keepers of the feather
The Keepers were first founded by Livius Martikov, Davian’s grandfather and a little-known accomplice of the paladin Lugdana, who rooted out nests of vampire spawn across the valley using the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind one hundred years ago.

As a younger man, Livius helped Lugdana and Burgomaster Ismark Antonovich steal the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind—then called the Sigil of the Sun—from Castle Ravenloft shortly after Strahd began his hibernation. (Livius stole it, as well as the Tome of Strahd, from the depths of the catacombs while Ismark and Lugdana distracted Strahd’s servants and children.)

It was Ismark the Great who proposed renaming the Sigil to be the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind in order to inspire the Barovian people and conceal its origins, crafting a tale in which an angel in the shape of a raven delivered the relic to Lugdana directly. (Livius always found the tale incredibly amusing.) Lugdana would continue to wield the Holy Symbol until her death fighting the Green God Chernovog, a greater demon conjured by the mad witch Baba Zelenna, atop Yester Hill. The Holy Symbol was thought lost when Lugdana fell—seemingly for good.
