# Ismark and Barovia
- The players have entered the land of Barovia, a realm surrounded by deadly fog and ruled by Strahd von Zarovich, a powerful vampire who slumbered in Castle Ravenloft until recently.
-Many outsiders and strangers have been drawn here, spirited into Barovia by the mists over the years, but they all die or disappear before long, . (Ismark has no knowledge of Death House, but vaguely remembers tales of unorthodox ways by which travelers have come to the valley.) There is no escaping Barovia once an outsider has entered it. Anyone who attempts to leave the land of Barovia begins to choke on the fog. Those who don't turn back perish.
- Just over three months ago, a man named Doru, the son of the village priest, raised a rebellion against the castle, hoping to free the valley from its prison in the mists. Their revolt failed, awakening Strahd from his dormancy and spurring the vampire to vow vengeance upon the village below.
- Several dozen Barovians fled to the town of Vallaki, almost a day’s travel to the west. The remainder stayed in the village, determined to defend their homes and those who were unable to make the journey.
Six nights ago, Strahd’s undead forces began attacking the town. Each night, the Barovians beat back multiple waves of the dead—and each night, the horde comes ever-closer to breaching the village’s defenses.
- Many Barovians fear that the village is doomed. The undead have infested the woods to the north, west, and south, blocking the Old Svalich Road just past the Ivlis River. With the Mists blocking passage to the east, the village has been effectively cut off from the world, left to survive on its own—or perish.
- Wolves, dire wolves, and werewolves prowl the Svalich
Woods, and hungry bats fill the skies at night.


- The village of Barovia sits at the east end of the valley.
Its burgomaster is named Kolyan Indirovich.
- The town of Vallaki lies in the heart of the valley. Its
burgomaster is named Baron Vargas Vallakovich.
- The fortified village of Krezk lies at the west end of
the valley and is built around an old abbey. The village.
burgomaster is named Dmitri Krezkov.
- Wine is the lifeblood of Barovia-for some, it is the
only reason to keep living. Barovian taverns get their
wine from the Wizard of Wines winery near Krezk.


##### BELIEFS AND SUPERSTITIONS
Two divine forces watch over the Barovian people: the
Morninglord and Mother Night.
- Before the curse of Strahd befell the land, the Morninglord
watched over the Barovian people from sunrise
until sundown. Now, the sun has not shone unobscured
for centuries, and the Morninglord no longer
answers their prayers.
- The presence of Mother Night is felt most strongly
between dusk and dawn, although nighttime prayers
to her go unanswered. It is widely believed that she
has forsaken the Barovian people and sent the devil
Strahd to punish them for their ancestors' offenses.
- Spirits drift along the Old Svalich Road toward Castle
Ravenloft in the dead of night. These phantoms are all
that remain of Strahd's enemies, and this damnable
fate awaits anyone who opposes him.
The Vistani serve the devil Strahd. They alone are allowed
to leave Barovia.
- Never harm a raven, lest ill fortune befall you!
