# Lorgoth on Lysaga
- The Forest Folk have come from Yester Hill to the south, which lies beside the Whispering Wall. (The Whispering Wall is largely as described in Y5. Wall of Fog, except that the ancient god that created the Wall was female.)
- The Forest Folk worship Strahd von Zarovich as a god, whom they call “the Shadowed Lord." The ravens of the winery and their masters, whom the Forest Folk call “the feathered ones," are old enemies of Strahd and his servants.
- The Forest Folk have come to “claim what is theirs"—ancient magic that the “feathered ones" stole from the druids’ ancestors long ago. To this end, they have allied with the “witch of the swamp," whose flying servants are called “strix," and whose children call her the “Mother of Darkness." They have also allied with a woman they call the “Child of Blood," whose mastery of magic has given them new power over the Gulthias tree and its spawn. (Lorghoth is referring to Baba Lysaga and Ludmilla Vilisevic, respectively.)
- The dead tree is a cutting of the Gulthias tree, which grows atop Yester Hill. Soon, nurtured by the Gulthias staff, it will grow to rival its parent, and give birth to blights of its own.
- Tomorrow at dawn, the mighty Wintersplinter will march from Yester Hill and reduce the winery to rubble, turning it into mulch to feed the young Gulthias tree. (Lorghoth won’t say who or what Wintersplinter is, except to cackle “Wintersplinter comes, and all will crumble in his wake!")
