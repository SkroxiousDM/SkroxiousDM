# Vladimir Horngaard on himself & Strahd
- In life, he was the commander of the Order of the Silver Dragon, the “valiant order" to which he devoted his life. He perished defending this valley from evil over four centuries ago; because of his failure, he is forever doomed.
- There is no monster Vladimir hates more than Strahd von Zarovich, an invader and tyrant who slew Argynvost and destroyed the Order of the Silver Dragon.
- Vladimir has forbidden his knights from killing Strahd or aiding his defeat because he believes Strahd must suffer eternally for his sins in a hell of his own creation, from which Strahd can never escape. “He sacrificed everything for his empire—faith, love, and youth," Vladimir growls. “Now, everything he ever wanted and everything he ever won is locked away beyond the mists, leaving him trapped in this land of ghosts." (Vladimir doesn’t know who or what the Dark Powers are, but believes that “dark powers" far greater than Strahd have seen fit to punish him for his crimes—a sentence that Vladimir is proud to uphold.)
- Because Strahd, a conqueror, craves adversaries to overcome, Vladimir has also forbidden his knights from slaying Strahd’s minions and creatures, a decision he believes will drive Strahd mad with boredom and despair. (If challenged with the suffering of the Barovian people, Vladimir snarls: “I would let a thousand nations burn if Strahd von Zarovich would choke on the ashes.")
