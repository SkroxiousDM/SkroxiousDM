# Muriel's confession
- She, like all of the members of the Keepers of the Feather, is a wereraven—a lycanthrope cursed to assume the form of a raven beneath the light of the full moon. (If asked, Muriel can confirm that Elric Martikov was the Keeper who bestowed the curse upon her, and who initiated her into the Keepers of the Feather.)
- Her lycanthropy allows her to assume the form of a raven or a raven-humanoid hybrid, and provides her with regenerative abilities and flight, though silvered weapons are lethal to her. If she took damage from Ludmilla’s shroud of mist, she shares that certain kinds of dark magic appear to be lethal to her as well.
- Her betrothed, Elric Martikov, was a wereraven who accompanied Doru’s rebellion in raven form, seeking to provide guidance to the ramshackle mob. He never returned from Castle Ravenloft—evidently, because Ludmilla killed him.
- If she lost control and attacked Ludmilla, Muriel sincerely and shamefacedly apologizes for doing so. “Everything felt so far away," she says, quietly. “I thought I was going to lose myself, I was so angry." If the players brought her back to her senses, she is deeply grateful to them for doing so.

- the players ask Muriel to curse them with wereraven lycanthropy, she laughs softly, and apologizes for disappointing them. “Even if I gave it to you, you couldn’t control it—not without months of proper training," she tells them.  Muriel apologetically refuses to say anything further on the subject, though she is glad to reassure the players that her refusal doesn’t arise from a lack of trust.
