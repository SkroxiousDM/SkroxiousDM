# Baron Krezkov on Krezk
- Residents never leave the village for fear of being attacked by wolves, dire wolves, and werewolves.
- Dmitri's sole two children are the thirteen-year-old Ilya and the eight-year-old Kala. Ilya recently went missing after a werewolf attack.
- About once a month, a wagonload of wine arrives from the Wizard of Wines, the winery and vineyard to the south. The business is owned and operated by the Martikov family.
- A pool at the north end of the village provides fresh water throughout the year. Next to the pool, the village's ancestors built a shrine to the Morninglord in a gazebo. It's known as the Shrine of the White Sun.
- The Abbey of Saint Markovia is named after a priest of the Morninglord who took a stand against the devil Strahd. After a fierce uprising, Markovia and her most loyal followers stormed Castle Ravenloft, only to be destroyed.
- The abbey was once a hospital and a convent, but it fell on hard times after the land was swallowed up by the mists. Some of the clergy fell prey to Strahd, while others went mad and either starved themselves to death or turned to cannibalism.
- The head of the abbey, called simply the Abbot, arrived over a century ago and hasn't aged a day since.
- He occasionally visits the Shrine of the White Sun but doesn't talk much, No one knows his true name or where he came from, and many believe he's Strahd's servant or the vampire himself in disguise. · ·
- Dmitri's late grandfather once spoke of a time when the Abbot was kind and compassionate, and cared for the sick and suffering of Barovia. (Dmitri isn't sure whether he believes this or not.)
- No one from the village visits the abbey anymore. The
abbey's bell rings at odd times, day and night, and the
place is filled with baleful screams and horrible, inhuman
laughter that can be heard throughout the village.
