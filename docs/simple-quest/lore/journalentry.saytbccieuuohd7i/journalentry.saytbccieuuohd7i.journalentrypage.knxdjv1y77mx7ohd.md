# Ludmilla on Wereravens
- Three months ago, when Doru's rebellion awoke Strahd from his slumber, there was a raven among them—but no ordinary raven. It seemed to possess an intelligence far beyond any ordinary beast.
- Strahd took the raven captive, and when Ludmilla returned to the castle—"to my Lord's service"—she was granted permission to investigate its properties. She soon found that the raven swiftly regenerated any wounds dealt to it, even those that seemed to be mortal—except those inflicted by silver or necrotic magic. She surmised that she had discovered a wereraven—a mythic counterpart to the wolfish lycanthropes that ranged in packs across the Barovian valley.
- With her research completed, Ludmilla moved to vivisect the creature, aiming to uncover any final hidden attributes. "It shrieked and squealed like a pig," she notes coldly, "but fortunately, the silver of its restraints burned it too fiercely for it to even contemplate the possibility of escape." (If Muriel is with the players, she begins to tremble, her hand curling tightly around the hilt of her shortsword until her knuckles turn white.)
- When the raven finally expired, it reverted to the form of a man—seemingly proving Ludmilla's theory. Ludmilla took the body to Baba Lysaga—an old colleague and mentor of hers—in Berez. Through Baba Lysaga's guidance, she tracked the wereraven to a seditious and traitorous family that dwelled in the Wizard of Wines winery—the Martikov clan.
- Baba Lysaga vowed to see the wereravens dead, and Ludmilla brokered an alliance between her and the druids of Yester Hill, who were eager to bring the downfall of any who defied their "Shadowed Lord." 
- It was sheer luck that Baba Lysaga's scarecrows uncovered the source of the winery's fecundity—a pair of enchanted gemstones that the Forest Folk recognized as heirlooms stolen from their ancestors. The druids were, understandably, eager to reclaim their heritage from the feathered usurpers.
