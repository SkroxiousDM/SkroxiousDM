# The Abbot on the Belviews
- Shortly after his arrival at the Abbey, a family suffering a debilitating, unwholesome disease, came to the abbey seeking salvation. Their hereditary condition, which struck in early adulthood, left its victims physically frail and prematurely aged in appearance.
- The Abbot could not heal their malady—a congenital disease, rather than a mere infection or wound—directly. However, he was able to ameliorate its effects through grafting the parts of beasts upon their ailing bodies, replacing blinded eyes with the eyes of a cat, arthritic knees with the legs of a dog, liver-spotted skin with the scales of a snake, or swollen feet with the hooves of a mule.
- The family’s illness, however, left their minds weak and vulnerable. The process, sadly, left their thoughts and emotions in a disturbed and unquiet state, requiring them to remain patients of the Abbey indefinitely, until their transformation could be perfected. The modern-day Belviews are their descendants. (The Abbot insists, if asked, that he is confident that he will one day find a cure for their condition.)
