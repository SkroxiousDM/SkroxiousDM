# Strahd on Kavan
"Long before my time, in the centuries before it came under my protection, Barovia was ruled by a different kind of darkness. His name was Kavan, warlord of the Mountain Tribes, and he swept forth from the Balinok Mountains like a raging storm to slaughter all who stood in his path. They called him Blood-Drinker, for the cursed spear he carried and his own, terrible thirst.

"Kavan, you see, was not of my kin. He was something far worse—a man of mortal lusts and ambitions. He drank the blood of his victims and buried himself beneath the red-stained soil when he slept, bathing in their terror and pain."

"His reign, though it lasted no longer than his lifetime, was an era of bloody excess—a testament to the depths of human brutality." Strahd's smile is thin and sharp, like broken glass. "Remember his tale as you walk these lands, for the echoes of the past never leave us, and the blood Kavan spilled still stains these hallowed hills."
