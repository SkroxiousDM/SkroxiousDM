# Arabelle's Prophecy
In darkest night, the light shall flee,

No dawn to break, with no reprieve.

From the grave, the dead shall climb,

Their restless march a baleful sign.

At castleâ€™s peak, a heart beats red,

Its hunger deep and ever-fed.

Should silence fall, the skies shall crack,

A thousand souls in torment black.
