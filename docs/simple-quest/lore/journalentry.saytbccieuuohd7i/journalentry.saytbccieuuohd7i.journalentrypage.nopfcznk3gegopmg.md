# Sir Godfrey  on Argynvost & Strahd
Long ago, before the Mists descended upon the valley, the Order of the Silver Dragon was an order of knights dedicated to justice and the protection of the weak. The order was founded by Lord Argynvost—a man of great wealth, kindness, and valor. Only Godfrey and the remainder of Argynvost’s most trusted knights knew Argynvost’s deepest secret: that he was, in truth, a silver dragon in disguise. 

Not ten years after the Order first settled at Argynvostholt, Strahd von Zarovich brought war to the lands surrounding the valley. The Order ranged far afield to defend against Zarovich’s invading armies and shelter those made refugees by the violence, but ultimately found itself driven back to the valley and, ultimately, the mansion of Argynvostholt.

A great battle took place on the floodplain east of the mansion, and many of the knights of the Order were slaughtered. As Godfrey and his commander, Vladimir Horngaard, led a final sortie against the enemy general’s camp, both were killed as well—Commander Horngaard by Zarovich himself, and Godfrey by Zarovich’s second-in-command: a cruel-eyed dusk elf bearing twin scimitars. (If asked, Godfrey can confirm that the elf was Rahadin, the current chamberlain of Castle Ravenloft.)

Several years thereafter, Godfrey felt Commander Horngaard’s rage pull his soul from beyond the grave, and found himself and the other knights of the Order returned to life as undead revenants. He learned that Zarovich had desecrated Argynvost’s remains, burning the dragon's bones and taking his skull as a trophy to the new Castle Ravenloft—an act so foul it had stirred Horngaard to vengeful hatred even in death.

The revenant knights renewed the fight against Strahd, waging war for months—until the Mists descended upon Barovia. The knights marched on Castle Ravenloft, where the Vistani crone Madam Eva met them at the castle gates. She told them Strahd had died and been reborn, and that he and all Barovia were now captives of the Mists.

Commander Horngaard and the knights returned to Argynvostholt. There, Commander Horngaard, his heart still clutched by hate, forbade the members of the Order from fighting Zarovich, who Commander Horngaard believed deserved to suffer in his prison for all eternity. Later, Commander Horngaard expanded his interdiction to Strahd’s servants and creatures as well, believing that Strahd’s dark dominion would only drive him to deeper levels of pain and misery—for what was a conqueror without anything left to conquer?

The knights of the Order reluctantly obeyed Horngaard’s order, even as they watched the people of Barovia sink deeper into despair. As Strahd slumbered in his tomb, many among them came to believe that the Barovians’ nightmare may one day lift—until a knight came bearing news of a failed rebellion from the village of Barovia to the southeast, and Strahd’s threat to wipe the village and its people from the valley.

A great quarrel erupted, as the knights demanded the right to defend the village from Strahd’s vengeance. Commander Horngaard, angered by their defiance, banished the other knights from the mansion. Only Godfrey, restrained by his bindings, did Horngaard allow to remain.

Argynvost may have fallen in the war against Strahd, but his spirit still lingers at Argynvostholt. In the decades after the Mists first descended, the dragon’s spirit appeared to Commander Horngaard in flickering visions, urging him away from his path of hatred and vengeance. However, Horngaard never turned from his path, and Argynvost’s spirit gradually fell quiet, sinking into a silent, dormant slumber.

Shortly after Strahd awoke from his hibernation, Argynvost’s spirit began to stir again, though Godfrey doesn’t know why. The dragon’s spirit is too old and weak to manifest directly, but several of the other ghosts that haunt the mansion’s halls claim to have heard him whispering in his ethereal slumber, murmuring of a new generation of heroes, and a new and final front in the fight against darkness.
When the knights of the order were banished from Argynvostholt, Godfrey sent them to seek out those who Argynvost might be searching for, and direct them toward the manor.
