# Dag on Elric and the Rebellion
- Just over three months ago, Elric Martikov, Elvir’s twin brother and Muriel’s betrothed, joined a rebellion in the village of Barovia that marched on Castle Ravenloft. Elric had always been bright-eyed and optimistic—a dreamer who believed in a better future for his loved ones. Davian forebade him from going, and ordered Elric never to return when he disobeyed. Davian’s words came true—Elric died in the castle, and his death shattered the Martikov family once again.
- Claudiu was especially close to his two youngest uncles, and Elric most of all. He and Elvir haven’t taken Elric’s death well, with both falling into a kind of melancholic despair and Elvir lashing out at anyone who gets on his bad side.
