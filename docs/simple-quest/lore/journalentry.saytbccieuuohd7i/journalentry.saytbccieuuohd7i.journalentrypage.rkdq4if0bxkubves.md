# Zuleika on the Silverthorn Collars
- The collars bear the stink of the swamp witch, Baba Lysaga. Each time she attempts to transform, they form magical silver thorns that pierce her neck, extinguishing her strength. Each time she or Ilya attempts to remove them, the collars form larger spikes, which dig deep into their necks and threaten to rip out their throats.
- Only Kiril has the key to their collars, which he wears on a cord around his neck made of tanned human sinews beside Zuleikaâ€™s wooden holy symbol. He never parts with them or removes them from his neck.
