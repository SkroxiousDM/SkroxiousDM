# Brother Marek on St. Markovia
- In life, he was the chaplain of the Order of the Silver Dragon. He perished defending the third-floor corridor when the forces of Strahd von Zarovich assaulted the mansion on the final day of the war.
- The stained-glass figure he is possessing is a depiction of Saint Andral, once the Moste High Priest of the Church of the Morninglord. The other two stained-glass figures are the angel Ithuriel and Saint Markovia, respectively. The stained-glass windows depict Saint Markovia’s anointment as a prophet of the Morninglord, in which Ithuriel placed a shard of his divinity in the icon he bestowed upon her.
- The players note Saint Andral’s apparent envy, Brother Marek agrees that many rumors once suggested that Saint Andral, who reinvigorated the Church’s power and reach after bestowing the crown of Old Zarovia upon King Barov von Zarovich II, was not pleased with the Morninglord’s decision to anoint Markovia instead of himself.
