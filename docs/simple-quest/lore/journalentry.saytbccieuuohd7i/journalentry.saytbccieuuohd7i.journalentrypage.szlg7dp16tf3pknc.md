# Bildrath on the Seige of Barova
- Just over three months ago, a pack of would-be "revolutionaries" marched off to Castle Ravenloft to "slay the vampire." Doru, the son of Father Donavich, the village priest, "filled their heads with fairy tales" of banishing the Mists and bringing the Sun back to Barovia.
- None of the revolutionaries ever came back. A few days later, a dusk-skinned elf came to the village and announced that the village had ninety days to make peace with the gods before the lord of Castle Ravenloft—now awoken after a hundred years of slumber—exacted penance for their disobedience.
- Some villagers left. Many others wanted to leave. However, Ismark delivered a resounding speech in the village square before the statue of Ismark the Great, promising the villagers that those who remained would stand and defend their homes. "The audacity of the bastard," Bildrath sneers. "Standing in front of his great-grandfather's statue like he was worth a tenth of him."
- Bildrath wanted to leave—but his sister, Marta, and her husband, Dragomir, chose to stay with their son, Parriwimple, inspired by Ismark's words. Unwilling to leave his family, Bildrath stayed as well. "They figured they'd fight to defend what's theirs," he chokes out, blinking back tears. "Bloody idiots should've run, and never looked back."
- Ninety days after the elf delivered his proclamation, the undead came, swarming in hordes dozens strong from the Svalich Wood. The villagers fought back, defending the streets with barricades, swords, and arrows. "But the dead kept coming," Bildrath croaks. "And Marta—" He falls silent. (Bildrath lost Marta and Dragomir in the attacks, and blames Ismark for his failure to protect them, which left Parriwimple—Bildrath's nephew—an orphan.)
- When he's regained his composure, Bildrath warns the players that the village is doomed, and likely all of Barovia with it. "There's no sun to bring back," he spits. "No escape from the mists. This is Hell, now and for all eternity. The sooner you lot accept that, the better off you'll be."
