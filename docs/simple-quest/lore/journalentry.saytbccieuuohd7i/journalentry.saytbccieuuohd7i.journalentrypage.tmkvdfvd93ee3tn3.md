# The Wrath of Strahd
Ninety days after Rahadin's proclamation, Strahd's undead army was finally complete. He unleashed the zombie horde against the village of Barovia—and, to punish Doru, sent him to the Barovian church to torment his father, Father Donavich.

The zombies’ siege of the town has lasted six days thus far, with the undead crashing against crude village fortifications night after night. Dozens of lives have been lost already, and many who remained have turned on Ismark, blaming him for dissuading them from fleeing for safety weeks before. Ismark—named for his ancestor “Ismark the Great”—is now mocked as “Ismark the Lesser.”

Meanwhile, as Strahd’s servants spread themselves across the valley, obedient once more to the vampire’s will, a creeping darkness is returning to corrupt the land. Shadows lurk in every corner, and the Mists watch silently as the horrors unfold.

Meanwhile, in a distant land far beyond the valley, several travelers arrive in the town of Daggerford, blissfully unaware of the trials that await . . .
