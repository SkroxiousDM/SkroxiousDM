# Clovin on the Belviews
- Long ago, Clovin’s ancestors came to the Abbey seeking a cure for a strange and mysterious illness. The Abbot healed them by perfecting their bodies, giving them new parts and traits that elevated them beyond their former, pitiful condition.
- The Abbot’s work, however, is not yet finished. The Belviews patiently await the day when their “blessed perfection" shall be complete—a day that Clovin believes is fast approaching. (If asked why, Clovin says only that his father, Cyrus, has only recently been perfected. Clovin shares that he is confident his turn shall come next, given his own long-standing loyalty and service to the Abbot.)
