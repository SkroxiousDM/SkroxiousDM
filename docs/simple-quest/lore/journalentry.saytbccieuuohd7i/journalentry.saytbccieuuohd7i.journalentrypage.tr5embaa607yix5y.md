# Davian's confession
- The Forest Folk didn’t attack merely because they are “bad neighbors." Davian and his family are members of the Keepers of the Feather—a secret society dedicated to aiding those who oppose Strahd von Zarovich and his servants. The Keepers of the Feather, which aim to guide and shelter others rather than fighting Strahd directly, uses ravens as their messengers and spies.
- Davian is the leader of the organization, and all of his children are also members. (Davian can confirm that Muriel Vinshaw and Urwin Martikov are also members of the Keepers of the Feather, as well as a number of other Barovians scattered across the valley.)
- Just over three months ago, one of Davian’s youngest sons—Elvir’s twin brother, Elric—planned to travel to Castle Ravenloft to join the revolt against Strahd. Davian forebade it, reminding Elric that the Keepers of the Feather were spies, not fighters, and that joining the rebellion openly could compromise the secret of their existence. Elric defied him and joined the revolt anyway.
- Elric died in Castle Ravenloft. Not long thereafter, Baba Lysaga’s scarecrows and the druids of Yester Hill—often accompanied by a mysterious, dark-skinned woman—began staging attacks against the winery. 
- The Winery’s best-kept secret is the source of its wine: three green gemstones the size and shape of pinecones enchanted with plant-growing magic. Since its founding, the Martikovs have used these gemstones to grow three vintages of wine: Champagne du le Stompe, Red Dragon Crush, and Purple Grapemash No. 3. 
- However, ten years ago, the gemstone producing the Champagne du le Stompe was stolen. Davian doesn’t know who stole it, but blames Urwin for failing to keep watch. Although Urwin claimed to have seen an old woman in the fog with a raven perched upon her shoulder, and the same raven carrying the gem away shortly thereafter, Davian has never believed his story—largely because the Keepers of the Feather know all of the ravens in the valley.
- Three weeks ago, Baba Lysaga’s scarecrows uncovered and stole the second gem, depriving the winery of the means of producing Red Dragon Crush. Five days ago, the Forest Folk attacked and stole the third gem, preventing the Martikovs from producing Purple Grapemash No. 3. The Keepers staged an attack on Yester Hill in an attempt to reclaim it, but were easily driven back. (“We’re spies," Davian notes mournfully, “not warriors.")
- The druids returned two days later, now joined by a small army of corrupted blights, and drove the Martikovs out. (Davian had never seen the Forest Folk command the blights of the Gulthias Tree before, and hadn’t known it to be possible.) 
- According to snippets of conversation that his family overheard before they were driven out of the winery, Davian believes that the druids have been searching for the first enchanted gem—the one stolen ten years prior. (Davian isn’t sure why the druids are searching for it, or how they came to know of it.)
