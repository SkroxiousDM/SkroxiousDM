# Stanimir's Tale
Stanimir fills his mouth with wine, then spits into the fire.
The flames turn from orange to green. As they dance and
sway, a dark shape appears in the bonfire's core.

"We come from an ancient land whose name is long
forgotten-a land of kings. Our enemies forced us from
our homes, and now we wander the lost roads."

The dark shape in the fire takes the form of a man being
knocked from his horse, a spear piercing his side.

Stanimir continues. "One night, a wounded soldier
staggered into our camp and collapsed. We nursed his
terrible injury and quenched his thirst with wine. He
survived. When we asked him who he was, he wouldn't
say. All he wanted was to return home, but we were deep
in the land of his enemies. We took him as one of our
own and followed him back toward his homeland. His
enemies hunted him. They said he was a prince, yet we
didn't give him up, even when their assassins fell upon
us like wolves."

Deep in the bonfire, you see the dark figure standing
with sword drawn, fighting off a host of shadowy shapes.

"This man of royal blood fought to protect us, as we
protected him. We bore him safely to his home, and he
thanked us. He said, 'I owe you my life. Stay as long as
you wish, leave when you choose, and know that you will
always be safe here."'

“The figure in the dancing fire vanquishes its final foe, then disperses in a cloud of smoke and embers.”
