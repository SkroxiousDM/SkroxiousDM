# Zuleika on the Shrine of Mother Night
- The werewolves call themselves the Children of Mother Night, and have offered her treasures and gifts for many generations. The hoard, however, is cursed: a creature that steals from Mother Night will lose its life in the process.
- When Strahd first awoke, he sent two vampire spawn to inform the pack of his revival. When those spawn attempted to collect some of the pack’s “treasure" as a tax to Strahd, the curse froze them and devoured their life force, rotting their bodies away until they died of necrosis. Emil then ordered their corpses bolted to the wall behind the shrine, as a warning to those who would steal from Mother Night. (“For all his efforts," Zuleika notes smugly, “Kiril has been quite unable to remove them. Even he fears Mother Night’s wrath, as well he should.")
- Zuleika doesn’t know what the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind is—only that the statue of Mother Night has worn it for decades.
