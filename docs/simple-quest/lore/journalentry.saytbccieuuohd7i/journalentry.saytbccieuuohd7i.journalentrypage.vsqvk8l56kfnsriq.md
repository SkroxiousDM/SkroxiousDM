# Ezmerelda on meeting Dr. Rudolph van Richten
"It was nearly two decades ago that I first saw him. My family was travelling with the Radanavich clan—a Vistani caravan—when a Radanavich child fell deathly ill. The child’s parents took him to a local doctor—a man by the name of Rudolph van Richten.

"Van Richten did all he could to keep the boy alive. Three days later, however, he passed away—and his father, a leader among the Radanaviches, blamed Van Richten for his child's death. That night, aided by four others, he stole into Van Richten's family home and kidnapped Van Richten's own son in vengeance.  My parents awoke me at midnight, and we departed at once. It was only later that I learned what cargo we were carrying—and that my own parents had helped acquire him.

"Van Richten himself, desperate to rescue him, tracked our caravan down and bound my parents to a tree. After extracting his son's location, however, he departed without shedding a drop of their blood—an act of mercy I have never forgotten.

"Ten years later, I ran from home, seeking to follow in Van Richten's footsteps. I found him a man changed—scarred and haunted by the years that had passed. His kindness, however, had never faded, and he agreed to take me on as his student. I spent two years with him, learning all I could about monsters and how to fight them, before we ultimately parted ways."

After finishing her story, Ezmerelda's expression darkens. "The night I departed his company, we exchanged harsh words—words I'd prefer to forget." She sighs. "Even so, when I received his final letter, I came at once to Barovia, praying that he would not face Zarovich alone."

If asked, Ezmerelda can share that the Radanaviches sold Van Richten’s son—a boy named Erasmus, with whom Ezmerelda had briefly played hoops as a child—to a cruel and hateful vampire called Baron Metus. “I never learned what became of him after that," she says, mournfully. “Dr. Van Richten never wished to speak of it."
