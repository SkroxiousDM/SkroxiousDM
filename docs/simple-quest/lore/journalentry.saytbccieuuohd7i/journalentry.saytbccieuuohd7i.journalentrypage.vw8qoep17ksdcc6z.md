# Ezmerelda on "The Black Terror"
"It was a year after I'd parted ways with Dr. Van Richten, and I felt as though no monster could challenge me. That's when I heard whispers of a beast known as the Black Terror—a werewolf that was the bane of several villages skirting the dark forests of Darkon. I vowed to track it and put an end to its reign of terror.

"It took many nights of investigation and research, but I finally caught sight of the beast at the edge of a shadowed swamp, its fangs stained red with the blood of its latest meal. My heart raced as I watched it slip into the mists—no ordinary fog, but the veil that shrouds the worlds themselves—and I knew that if I failed to pursue it, I might be forced to begin my hunt anew.

In my arrogance, I thought I could handle whatever lay beyond. I was a Vistani—a born wanderer of the Mists—and a student of Rudolph van Richten himself. I plunged ahead without a second thought—and the Black Terror ambushed me, springing from the gloom with claws and teeth. He tore off my leg below the knee, my bright blood staining his charcoal hide.

In that moment, I knew I would die, alone and powerless—until Dmitri and Anna emerged from the woods, cold silver flashing in their hands. The werewolf fled, and the Krezkovs brought me back to their home, where they nursed me back to health. When I recovered, they took me to Vallaki and commissioned the local toymaker, a brilliant man called Blinsky, to craft me a new leg. To this day, this leg reminds me of the importance of caution—and the dangers of unchecked zeal.

When her story ends, Ezmerelda gazes into the flames. "I owe the Krezkovs a debt I can never repay," she says softly. "But finding Ilya and returning him home, safe and sound—that would be a start."

Ezmerelda isn’t sure whether the Black Terror still lingers in Barovia. “I very nearly hope he does," she says, a wry smile on her lips. Her grip tightens around her silvered handaxe. “I have a gift I’d like to give him."
