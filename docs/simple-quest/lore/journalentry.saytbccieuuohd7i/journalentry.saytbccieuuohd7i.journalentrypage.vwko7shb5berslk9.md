# Baron Krezkov on recent history
- Recently, a werewolf attacked the village of Krezk, somehow managing to bypass its walls. In its rampage, it wounded many and killed Kala. (“I held her in my arms as she died," Dmitri sobs. “Half her side was missing. She kept whispering, ‘Daddy’ and ‘Mommy’ over and over again, until she finally fell still.")
- The Krezkovs’ son, Ilya, vanished in the chaos, and hasn’t been seen in days. (If the players located Ilya in Arc I - The Walls of Krezk, Dmitri adds that, until recently, they feared him to be dead as well.)
The Krezkovs prayed to the Morninglord for guidance and deliverance, begging for mercy and salvation—and the Abbot answered.
- The following morning, the Abbot’s bestial servants—a pair of creatures who called themselves Otto and Zygfrek—invited the mourning Krezkovs to the Abbey. There, the Abbot offered a bargain, promising to resurrect Kala in full health if Anna promised to sacrifice her heart to the Abbot’s foul creation: the flesh golem he calls Vasilka. To Dmitri’s horror, Anna accepted—and the Abbot brought Kala back to life.
- The Abbot gave Anna one month’s time to make peace with her family and neighbors—an act he called “the Morninglord’s mercy." The Krezkovs don’t have much time left. (The Abbot’s deadline expires two weeks and one day after the players’ first full moon in Vallaki.)
- Kala hasn’t been the same since her resurrection. Dmitri and Anna haven’t asked, but they’re terrified that she remembers the experience of dying—and that what she saw beyond the veil of mortality scarred her forever. The life and laughter have gone out of her, and she spends much of her time staring at the grave her parents once prepared for her.
