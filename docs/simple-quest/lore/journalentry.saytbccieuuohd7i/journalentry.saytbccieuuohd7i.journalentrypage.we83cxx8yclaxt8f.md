# The Darkened Valley
<div><p>Two weeks now had passed since the failed revolt, and Strahd began gathering hordes of undead to serve his wrathful will. Upon learning of his dark designs, the revenant knights of the Order of the Silver Dragon demanded that their commander, Vladimir Horngaard, release them from their vows and permit them to warn and defend the village. Enraged by their defiance, Vladimir banished his knights from the mansion and commanded them to secrecy, allowing only Sir Godfrey Gwilym to remain.</p></div>

Victor Vallakovich and Stella Wachter—the children of Baron Vallakovich and Lady Fiona Wachter—activated a prototype teleportation circle, dreaming of escaping Strahd's tyranny. The circle malfunctioned, however, sending Stella's spirit into the Ethereal Plane—where the vengeful spirit of Leo Dilisnya severed it from her body. Enraged by Stella's fate, Lady Wachter began recruiting a cult to Ezra to depose the Vallakovich clan.</p></div>

In Krezk, the Abbot completed a prototype of his own: a monstrous flesh golem, which he set to patrolling S15. Madhouse (p. 151). He swiftly began work on his next project: a masterpiece to serve as Strahd's final bride.

Not long thereafter, Kasimir Velikov, investigating the secrets of the Amber Temple at Patrina's direction, visited the now-empty manor of Argynvostholt and spoke with Sir Godfrey. Though Godfrey warned him to avoid the darkness that lay within the temple, Kasimir did not leave empty-handed, finding amidst the rubble an ancient map that bore the temple's location.

As Kasimir prepared to climb the slopes of Mount Ghakis, 
As the Abbot's grave-robbing intensified, Kasimir attempted to reach the Amber Temple, but was turned back by the vrocks of Tsolenka Pass at T2. Demon Statues (p. 157). Wounded and despondent, Kasimir returned to the dusk elves’ settlement to ponder his next move.
