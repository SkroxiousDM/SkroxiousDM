# why Ismark is called "the Lesser,"
- When Strahd's dusk elf servant—a cruel-looking man named Rahadin—delivered his warning three months ago, many Barovians were prepared to flee the village for Vallaki.
- Ismark, however, delivered a thundering and inspiring speech, invoking the memory of Lugdana and Ismark the Great to encourage them to stay and fight for their homes. Most did so.
- When Strahd's siege began, many who lost homes or loved ones blamed Ismark, who they felt had led them astray with his foolish fantasies of heroism and valor. They now call him "Ismark the Lesser" in mockery of his ancestry.
- No one feels more guilty or ashamed than Ismark himself, who has taken the weight of every death incurred in the siege on his own shoulders.
