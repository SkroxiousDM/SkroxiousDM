# Kavan on the Forest Folk
- The druids of the Forest Folk have been more active lately, gathering berserkers from the northern basin and leading blights of the Gulthias Tree down to the lands below. They appear to have obtained a new leader: a dark-skinned woman clad in a white gown and a golden tiara, with piercing eyes and a pair of sharp fangs. Kavan believes her to be a mage, having seen her conjure strange lights and sounds. (This is Ludmilla Vilisevic, one of Strahd’s vampiric brides.)
- Recently, the Forest Folk of Yester Hill—which Kavan’s people once called Sarmizeget—obtained something both new and yet incredibly old: an enchanted gemstone once belonging to Kavan's people that he thought lost long ago. The Forest Folk have constructed an enormous effigy of wood and earth atop the hill, within the great stone circle that serves as their meeting place, and placed the gemstone within the statue’s chest.
- Some of the Forest Folk appear to be preparing to instill the power of the gemstone within the statue, which is woven from the roots of the Gulthias Tree that grows atop Yester Hill. The ritualists have bonded themselves to the tree’s bloodthirsty roots, and plan to harness the power of the eternal storm above Yester Hill to give life to the being within the statue.
- The Gulthias Tree is a dark and corrupted entity, and an accomplice to the druids’ will. Kavan warns them that the tree might attempt to obstruct their efforts, but informs them that radiance burns it and slows its new growth. He notes that the tree thirsts especially for cursed blood, which strengthens and restores it.
- There are more than a dozen druids and berserkers now atop Yester Hill, though more have been arriving every day. They appear to be waiting for the one they call the “Shadowed Lord"—the lord of the fortress to the east. (Kavan is referring to Strahd von Zarovich and Castle Ravenloft.)
