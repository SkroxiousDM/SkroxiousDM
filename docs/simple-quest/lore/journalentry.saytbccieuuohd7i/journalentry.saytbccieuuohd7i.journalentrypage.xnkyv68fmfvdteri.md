# Muriel's overheard prophecy involving Strahd.
"The Darklord—the master of shadows, the beast in the labyrinth that tears at his chains.

"The Six of Stars, the Evoker—the power you covet, a force untamed by mortal hands, raw and wild with burning fury.

"The Artifact—the token you seek, the key to power. Divinity’s heart waits, but where?

"The Innocent. I see a maid of raven hair and twilit eyes. She is one way to the token.

"But there is another—the Broken One. The path of sacrifice opens another door. The wall that whispers awaits your tribute."
