# Lady Wachter & Leo Dilisnya
When Lady Wachter was a young woman, her parents and brother were killed in a mysterious incident that left their bodies apparently unharmed. Lady Wachter was the sole survivor, having been away from Wachterhaus at the time of the killing.

When she returned to Wachterhaus, she determined that a malevolent spirit had been responsible for her family’s death. Though the spirit appeared to have departed by the time Lady Wachter returned, she was wary of the prospect that it might one day return.

Using magic that she had learned from her mentor, Lysa, Lady Wachter erected a protective barrier around Wachterhaus that would prevent any creature within the Ethereal Plane from crossing over the boundary of the property.

Leo Dilisnya, a guard of Castle Ravenloft. When Strahd killed his brother, Sergei, and pursued Sergei’s bride, Tatyana, through the castle gardens, it was Leo who gave the order for the guards to kill Strahd to defend Tatyana and avenge Sergei’s death.

When Strahd became a vampire, he slaughtered his castle guards in a bloody and gruesome massacre. Lady Lovina Wachter née Dilisnya, Leo’s sister and a faithful devotee of Strahd von Zarovich, directed her bodyguards to assist Strahd in the bloodshed.

Leo himself barely escaped, and hid himself away in the deserted Abbey of Saint Markovia on a spur of Mount Baratok. However, Strahd and Lovina eventually found him—and when they did, they turned him into a vampire spawn and sealed him in a lightless stone vault beneath Wachterhaus.

They left him there to starve for four hundred years, slowly growing mad as the bloodthirst destroyed his mind and his hatred sharpened and burned. (“Do you have any idea what that’s like?” the gallows speaker snarls, the faces within its cloak moaning with a chorus of mournful wails. “Feeling your sanity slip away, year by year, as the hunger within you twists and grows, never to be sated?”)

More than thirty years ago, Leo finally died, his spirit arising as a ghost that reunited with the tormented spirits of the castle guards, forming a gallows speaker. As he lurked unseen among Wachterhaus, he came to learn that he had been granted the release of death on the same night that Fiona Wachter—then a teenager—had fled her family estate, destroying an enchanted ruby gemstone that Strahd had given Lovina’s family as security should Leo ever escape.

Not long after his death, Leo killed the Wachters that remained at Wachterhaus, but was unable to finish the job when Fiona Wachter sealed him out. Now, however, Leo seeks to “rip out the poisoned Wachter family tree, root and branch,” and finally “see justice done.”

In life, Leo was an assassin of the Ba’al Verzi who betrayed his order’s vows when he sought to kill Strahd in vengeance for the death of his brother, Reinhold, who Strahd knowingly sent to die to win a battle against the Order of the Silver Dragon.

On the morning of Sergei’s wedding, Leo climbed to the window of Strahd’s royal chambers, carrying with him a cursed Ba’al Verzi dagger that prevented its victims from being resurrected.

When Lovina Wachter’s bodyguards engaged the castle guards to defend Strahd, it was Leo who gave the order to have the Wachters themselves killed, furious that his sister had elected to “betray” him and Reinhold’s memory.
