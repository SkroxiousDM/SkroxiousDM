# Witches of Mother Night
While the good-hearted worshippers of Barovia keep the faith of the Morninglord alive, other, darker individuals seek the power and favor of Mother Night instead. Chief among them is Baba Lysaga, the Witch of Berez, who has fostered a coven of fellow devotees by recruiting outcasts and exiles from the settlements of Barovia. The maddened Lysaga views these practitioners as her children, and teaches them to secretly consider themselves the younger siblings of Strahd â€” sworn to protect and obey him for eternity.
