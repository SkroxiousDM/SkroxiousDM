# Forest Folk
The Forest Folk are one of two groups descended from the hunter-gatherer nomads who first settled the valley.

Nearly five centuries ago, when Strahd first invaded Barovia, a group of druidic elders approached him in secret with an offer. Fearful of repeating the oppression their people had once suffered under King Dostron, the elders told Strahd that they would guide him to the sacred places of the valley—the Fanes of the Ladies Three—and teach him the secrets of unlocking their power. In exchange, the elders asked for Strahd’s protection, and his promise that he would leave them in peace in a valley now flooded with blood and ghosts.


Recently, the Forest Folk were approached by Ludmilla Vilisevic, one of Strahd’s brides and an envoy from Baba Lysaga, the Witch of Berez. Ludmilla carried information indicating that the Keepers of the Feather, a secret society of wereravens that opposed Strahd’s rule, used the nearby Wizard of Wines Winery as one of their hideouts. With Ludmilla’s aid, the druids of the Forest Folk fashioned a way to create and command blights—the children of the Gulthias Tree—and declared war upon the winery and all its inhabitants.
