# The Werewolf Pack
The werewolf pack has historically been bloodthirsty and brutal, but became far more reserved—even peaceful—a decade after Strahd entered hibernation. Presumably it was a change of leadership, following the absence of pressure from the castle. With Strahd awoken, however, their aggression has reemerged.
