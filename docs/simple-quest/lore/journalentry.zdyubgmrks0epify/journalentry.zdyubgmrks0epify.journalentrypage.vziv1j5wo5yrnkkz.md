# Cult of Ezra
Some Barovians are neither wholly satisfied with the faith of the Morninglord nor depraved enough to seek the blessings of Mother Night. In their eyes, the Morninglord is a powerless or craven deity, unable to save his own worshippers or even raise a single sunrise, while Mother Night is a cruel and savage being, too dangerous to acknowledge or worship.

These Barovians walk a middle path, and instead worship Ezra, the Mistwalker: the god of the Mists, or—as some suggest—the embodiment of the Mists themselves. (See Ezra, God of the Mists, Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft at p. 64, for more information.)

In Barovia, the followers of Ezra preach that power is an illusion, and suffering life’s only constant. Many believe that tales of the sun are myths, and that Barovia has neither past nor future: only an unceasing present that must be forever endured.

Lady Fiona Wachter of Vallaki is a quiet worshipper of Ezra, as are her followers. Many turn to Ezra for comfort in times of tragedy, finding it easier to believe that hope is an illusion than to believe that it may be attained and then lost.

Lady Wachter rejects the Morning lord. Instead, she heeds the word of Ezra, goddess of the Mists, who teaches her followers to look past one’s hopes, to recognize them as the fog that clouds the mind, and to see the world as it truly is and shall forever be. It is Ezra who teaches her followers to endure what must be endured. After all, the oak fights the wind and is broken, but the willow bends when it must and survives.
