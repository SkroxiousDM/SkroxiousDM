# Vistani
The Vistani (singular: Vistana) are wanderers who live
outside civilization, traveling about in horse-drawn, barrel-
topped wagons called vardos, which they build themselves.
Compared to Barovians, they are flamboyant. Vistani dress in bright clothes, laugh often, arid drink heartily. As much as they feel at home in.Strahd's dreary land, they know they can leave it whenever they please and aren't damned to spend eternity there.

Vistani are silversmiths, coppersmiths, haberdashers,
cooks, weavers, musicians, entertainers, storytellers,
toolmakers, and horse traders. They also earn money
by telling fortunes and selling information. They spend
whatever they earn to support a lavish lifestyle, display
their wealth openly as a sign of prosperity, and share
their good fortune with family and friends.

Each family or clan of Vistani is its own little gerontocracy,
with the oldest member ruling the roost. This
elder. carries the bulk of the responsibility for enforcing
traditions, settling disputes, setting the course for the
group's travels, and preserving the Vistani way of life.
Vistani elders make all the important decisions, but
whether by choice or because of their age, tend to speak
in cryptic, flowing riddles.

Vistani families and clans are closely knit. They resolve disagreements through contests that end with reconciliatory singing, dancing, and storytelling. Although they can seem lazy and irresponsible to outsiders, the Vistani are serious people, quick to act when their lives or traditions are threatened. They are merciless when they believe they must be. Vistani who knowingly bring harm or misfortune to others of their kind are banished- the worst punishment a Vistana can imagine, even worse than death.


***STRAHD'S VISTANI SERVANTS***<br>
During one of Strahd's military campaigns, years before he became a vampire, a group of Vistani rescued him after he was wounded in battle. These Vistani not only nursed Strahd back to health but also delivered him safely home. As a reward for their generosity, Strahd declared that all Vistani had the right to come and go from his land as they please, and this privilege extends to the present day. Thus, Vistani can travel freely through the fog that surrounds Barovia, without fear of harm or entrapment.

Strahd honors his debt to the Vistani in part because he envies the Vistani way of life-the freedom they have to go where they please, their devotion to family, and their festive spirit. The courtesy he shows them is not simply a matter of honor but is also born from his admiration of them.

In the centuries since Strahd became a vampire, many Vistani have allowed themselves to be corrupted by Strahd, to the extent that they consider him their king. Vistani who serve Strahd are less lively and friendly than normal Vistani, and their hearts are poisoned with dark intentions. Strahd uses them to lure adventurers into his domain and keep him informed about the events occurring in lands beyond his reach. These Vistani will lie to protect the vampire, and they fear the  onsequences of disobeying him.

When it comes to sharing information about their dark master, Strahd's Vistani pretend to be helpful, but the information they impart is misleading at best and often deceptive. They readily tell adventurers that they have a potion that protects them from the deadly fog that surrounds Barovia. Although this is a lie, they attempt to sell their fake potion for as much money as they can get.

with two major semi-permanent settlements: the encampment at Tser Pool, and the encampment near Vallaki. 

However, most Barovian Vistani view the valley as a temporary shelter from the evils of the world beyond, or as a brief stopover on their journeys through the mists. Only a few Vistani within Barovia reside there permanently and regard Strahd as their "king"; among those that do, even fewer serve Strahd faithfully as his eyes, ears, and hands amidst the valley. Most Barovian Vistani simply want to live their lives, to partake in life's wonders, and to raise their families in peace.
