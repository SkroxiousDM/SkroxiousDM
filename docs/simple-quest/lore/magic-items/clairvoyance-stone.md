# Clairvoyance Stone
 This smooth, polished, palm-sized stone is engraved with a carving of a circular, avian eye. While holding the stone to their eye, the stone’s holder can use their action to whisper a location permitted by the *clairvoyance* spell. The holder then gains the effects of the _clairvoyance_ spell.

> The stone can be used to cast the _clairvoyance_ spell three times. The third time the spell is cast, the stone crumbles to dust after the spell ends.
