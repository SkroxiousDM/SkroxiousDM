# Dragon blessed weapon
The weapon becomes a +1 magical weapon of its kind, and has 3 charges. It regains all expended charges at dawn.
- The weapon’s wielder can use 1 charge as a bonus action to imbue the weapon with silver flames for the next 1 minute. While the flames remain, each of the creature’s attacks deals an additional 1d4 cold damage. In addition, if the weapon’s wielder rolls a critical hit while the flames remain, the target must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed until the start of the wielder’s next turn.
- The weapon’s wielder can use 2 charges as a bonus action to cast the beacon of hope spell.
- The weapon’s wielder can use 3 charges as an action to create a blast of silver flame, which takes the shape of a 15-foot cone for a melee weapon and a 30-foot line for a ranged weapon. Each hostile creature in that area must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw, taking 58 (13d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once this feature is used, it can't be used again for one year.
