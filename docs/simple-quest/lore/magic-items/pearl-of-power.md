## Pearl of Power
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)

While this pearl is on your person, you can use an action to speak its command word and cast one spell of 3rd level or lower that you know. You gain no Corruption from casting this spell. Once you have used the pearl, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
