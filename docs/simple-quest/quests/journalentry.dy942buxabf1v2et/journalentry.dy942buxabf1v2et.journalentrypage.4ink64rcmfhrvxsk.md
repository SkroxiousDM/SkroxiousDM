# Arc M - The Dragon's Manor
- travel to Argynvostholt and speak to Sir Godfrey Gwilym
He awaits those who would raise their swords against the darkness of Strahd. The knights of the Order of the Silver Dragon opposed the lord of Ravenloft in life.
- seek out the clues left by the dragon’s spirit by speaking with the other ghosts of the mansion
the slumbering spirit of the silver dragon Argynvost—the deceased leader of their Order—has stirred in recent weeks, and that the dragon is seeking heroes willing to stand against Strahd.<br>
Pseudodragon familiar => Minodora, the spirit of a former clerk of the Order of the Silver Dragon => Brother Marek, the spirit of the Order's former chaplain:
- “Seek out the younger of the twin dragons above. Reignite the silver flame it once wielded, and remind it of the oath it once served. Do this, and the memory of the Silver Dragon may return to fill it once more."

- Retrieve Argynvost's Skull from Castle Ravenloft

- Light the Beacon
