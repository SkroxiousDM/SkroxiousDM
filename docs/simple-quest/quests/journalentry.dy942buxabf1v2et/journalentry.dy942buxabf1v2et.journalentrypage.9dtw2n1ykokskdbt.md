# Arc L - The Den of Wolves
- Investigate the werewolf den the 13th night of Neyavr, while the bulk of the pack is away hunting.

    - Ezmerelda found what she believes to be Ilya’s location: a cavern at the base of a spur of Mount Baratok along the northwestern shore of Lake Baratok. Barovia’s werewolf pack uses the cave as its den, making any effort to rescue Ilya tremendously risky. After capturing and interrogating a werewolf with the Barovian pack, Ezmerelda learned that the bulk of the pack will soon be departing Barovia to range beyond the Mists with Strahd's permission. The pack's expedition will take place at dusk the 13th night of Neyavr. "My source didn't know how long the pack would be away," she notes. "It might be anywhere from twelve hours until twelve days, so we'll want to get in and out before dawn."
 - Travel to Ezmerelda's caravan to gather supplies.
 - Stake out the mouth of the cave
