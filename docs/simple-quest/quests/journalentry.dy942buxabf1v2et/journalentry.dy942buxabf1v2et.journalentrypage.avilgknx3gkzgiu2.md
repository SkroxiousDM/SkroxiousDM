# Retrieve the Long-lost Spear of the Huntress from Dostron's Tomb in Castle Ravenloft
Kavan tells them where to find the spear that he stole from the Forest Fane of the Huntress, whose return may convince the people of Soldav to grant them entry. “The spear's power waned when I took it, and it has no doubt grown ever-weaker since," he says. "But, should it serve your purposes, you can find it in the tomb of King Dostron, who claimed it from my tent when my chiefdom crumbled in the wake of his armies."
Kavan can inform the players that the tomb of King Dostron was hewn from the stone beneath Dostron’s fortress, which Dostron built in the eastern mountains—upon what is now called the Pillarstone of Ravenloft. Should they find it, Kavan asks that they take it to the shrine of the Ladies Three in Soldav, to reconsecrate it in the sacred spring there and redeem his past mistakes.
