# Card 4
~~*"This card sheds light on one who will help you greatly in the battle against darkness."*<br>
a quiet graveyard choked with fog, its entrance sealed with a sharp iron fence. "The Mists."<br>
***"A Vistana wanders this land alone, searching for her mentor. She does not stay in one place for long. Seek her out at Saint Markovia's abbey, near the mists."***<br>~~
**You have met Ezmirelda D'Avenir at St. Markovias Abbey**
