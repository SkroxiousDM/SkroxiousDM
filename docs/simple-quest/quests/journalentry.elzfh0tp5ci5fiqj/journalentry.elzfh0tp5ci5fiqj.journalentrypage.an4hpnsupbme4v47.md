# Card 3
*"This is a card of power and strength. It tells of a weapon of vengeance: a sword of sunlight."*<br>
a solemn-faced man clad in holy vestments, one hand clutching the chain of a bronze censer that billows with burning smoke. “The Eight of Glyphs—the Bishop.”<br>
***"What you seek lies in a prison of darkness, beyond a set of amber doors. This weapon is long hidden. The house of the fallen dragon can lead you there."***<br>
