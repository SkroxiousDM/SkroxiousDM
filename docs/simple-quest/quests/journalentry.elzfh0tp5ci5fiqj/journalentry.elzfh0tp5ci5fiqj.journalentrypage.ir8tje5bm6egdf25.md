# Card 5
*"Your enemy is a creature of darkness, whose powers are beyond mortality. When the hour of judgment arrives, this card will lead you to him!"*<br>
a depiction of a crowned, grinning emperor clad in royal finery and reaching for a goblet of wine—though his limbs are wooden puppet’s limbs, lashed to corded strings that disappear into the darkness overhead. "The Marionette."<br>
***"Look to great heights. Find the beating heart of the castle. He waits nearby."***<br>
