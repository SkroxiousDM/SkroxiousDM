# Card 2
*"This card tells of a powerful force for good and protection, a holy symbol of great hope."*<br>
 an armored warrior clutching a cracked iron sword and a leather-bound wooden shield, his face obscured by a heavy iron helmet. “The Five of Swords—the Myrmidon.”<br>
***"Look for a den of wolves in the hills overlooking a mountain lake. The treasure belongs to Mother Night."***<br>
