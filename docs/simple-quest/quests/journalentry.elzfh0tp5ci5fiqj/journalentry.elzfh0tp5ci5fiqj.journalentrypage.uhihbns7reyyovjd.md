# Card 1
{The Tarokka Reading}~~*"This card tells of history. Knowledge of the ancient will help you better understand your enemy."*<br>
A smirking guardsman looking up at a haughty priest, the priest’s pointing fingers mere inches from the guardsman’s nose as the guardsman readies a wickedly curved dagger behind his back. “The Nine of Glyphs—the Traitor.”<br>
***"I see the ancient foe of an old and noble house. The wandering soul will guide you to him."***<br>~~
**You are pretty sure this was the spirit of Leo Dilisnya He dropped a Book that you have as yet been unable to open.**
