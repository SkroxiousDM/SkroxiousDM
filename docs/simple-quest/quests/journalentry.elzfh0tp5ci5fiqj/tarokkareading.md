# The Tarokka Reading
- card 1
~~“This card tells of history. Knowledge of the ancient will help you better understand your enemy.”
A smirking guardsman looking up at a haughty priest, the priest’s pointing fingers mere inches from the guardsman’s nose as the guardsman readies a wickedly curved dagger behind his back. “The Nine of Glyphs—the Traitor.”
“I see the ancient foe of an old and noble house. The wandering soul will guide you to him.”~~
**You are pretty sure this was the spirit of Leo Dilisnya He dropped a Book that you have as yet been unable to open.**
- card 2
  _**“This card tells of a powerful force for good and protection, a holy symbol of great hope.”**
an armored warrior clutching a cracked iron sword and a leather-bound wooden shield, his face obscured by a heavy iron helmet. “The Five of Swords—the Myrmidon.”
  **“Look for a den of wolves in the hills overlooking a mountain lake. The treasure belongs to Mother Night.”**_

- card 3
_**“This is a card of power and strength. It tells of a weapon of vengeance: a sword of sunlight.”**
a solemn-faced man clad in holy vestments, one hand clutching the chain of a bronze censer that billows with burning smoke. “The Eight of Glyphs—the Bishop.”
**“What you seek lies in a prison of darkness, beyond a set of amber doors. This weapon is long hidden. The house of the fallen dragon can lead you there.”**_

- card 4
~~“This card sheds light on one who will help you greatly in the battle against darkness.”
a quiet graveyard choked with fog, its entrance sealed with a sharp iron fence. “The Mists.”
“A Vistana wanders this land alone, searching for her mentor. She does not stay in one place for long. Seek her out at Saint Markovia’s abbey, near the mists.”~~
**You have met Ezmirelda D’Avenir at St. Markovias Abbey**

- card 5
_**“Your enemy is a creature of darkness, whose powers are beyond mortality. When the hour of judgment arrives, this card will lead you to him!”**
a depiction of a crowned, grinning emperor clad in royal finery and reaching for a goblet of wine—though his limbs are wooden puppet’s limbs, lashed to corded strings that disappear into the darkness overhead. “The Marionette.”
**“Look to great heights. Find the beating heart of the castle. He waits nearby.”**_
