- research its secrets in the Baron’s personal library in Vallaki and uncover Arabelle’s location.

- gain access to Baron Vargas Vallakovich’s personal library

- In exchange for the players’ promise to bring back any relics found therein—including, if possible, a proper wizard’s staff—Victor tells them that the sigil was the personal symbol of the archmage Khazan, whose abandoned tower sits on the shores of Lake Baratok

- Victor doesn’t know how to get there, he can direct the players to Szoldar Szoldarovich, a Vallakian wolf-hunter who knows the Svalich Woods well. You can hire Szoldar as a guide, or simply buy him a drink to get directions to Lake Baratok
