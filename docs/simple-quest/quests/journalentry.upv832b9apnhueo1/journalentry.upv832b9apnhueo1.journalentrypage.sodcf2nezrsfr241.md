# Arc J - The Stolen Gem
- Urwin asks the players to travel to the Wizard of Wines and speak with the owner, a man named Davian Martikov, to discern the reason for the delay and resolve it, if necessary

- Davian asks the players to defeat the Forest Folk and break the staff that their leader uses to control the blights, allowing the Martikovs to reclaim their home.

- Davian asks the players and Muriel to journey to Yester Hill and prevent Wintersplinter’s birth. 

- Davian also asks the players to retrieve an enchanted gemstone that the winery previously used to grow grapes before it was stolen by the druids.
