After all, a huge portion of the job is risking danger. Pain and death are obvious and appropriate fears that most adventurers will face often. It may add flavor to some characters to make this a fear of specific injury: for instance, a bard may be terrified of an injured hand, which will affect her music. Some characters may need an even subtler approach. A strong fighter may fear their body aging, thus losing their defining trait. A character obsessed with strength can even fear an inadequacy that does not exist, frightened of a weakness she does not possess.</p> <p>Carefully consider what your character feels is important and what he or she would do to protect that.

It can also work against her, constructing invisible enemies and threats out of harmless things. Shadows can be signs of lurking horror; coincidence can be a sign of a superior enemy; an oddly phrased sentence can be a sign of conspiracy. Adventurers make calculations about danger out of necessity. Fear lies in how they draw those conclusions and react to them. The mind is also the space where characters catalog their plans and resources. Any anxiety about failure, readiness, or progress is felt through the mind. Certain heroes are dependent on their minds in ways others are not. For a wizard, his mind and ability to study are paths to power. It is easy to tie this story to fears of inadequacy and anxiety over sense of self. Fears of the mind are less visceral than others, but they carry no less weight.</p> <p>To create a mind-based fear for your character, consider what you know and focus on the dangers you find most important. For instance: \u00a0 Anxiety \u00a0 Lack of preparation \u00a0 Feeling lost \u00a0 Post-traumatic stress \u00a0 Lack of valuable information \u00a0 Existential dread</p>"},{"location":"1.%20Start%20Here/Backstory%20Questions/#the-soul","title":"The Soul","text":"<p>The world of fantasy offers boundless possibilities for exploring spiritual themes. A lot of what is abstract in real life takes concrete form in fantasy. It is very possible to play a character who simply fears evil as a force. A story about good and evil on a conceptual level becomes more grounded when you have a character embody those concepts. Evil is very easy to understand when it can swing a sword at you. You can even create internal conflict by exploring the thought process of a good person for whom violence is an unavoidable aspect of life. Fearing personal corruption is a great way to add weight to actions and decisions your character must make.</p> <p>To construct a spiritual fear, ask difficult questions about your character\u2019s beliefs and behavior. Create an emotional attachment to his or her sense of justice and find the areas where there are no easy answers. For instance: \u00a0 The nature of evil \u00a0 The fragility of virtue \u00a0 A specific evil person \u00a0 Personal corruption \u00a0 Crisis of faith \u00a0 Cosmic horror \u00e0 la H.P.

The way you interact with other characters drives a great deal of the story. Rejection is an easy theme around which to build fear. Our world is already fraught with social strife surrounding appearance and acceptance. Adding features like tusks, tails, and otherworldly fire to other characters or NPCs (non-player characters) makes differences more overt and easier to play with. Facing rejection is especially terrifying when one\u2019s way of life depends on trusting other people. On the other side of the coin, intimacy is another common heroic fear. Allowing yourself to care about others makes the pain of loss more pronounced and opens you up to new vulnerabilities. Fear of intimacy raises the stakes on otherwise mundane interactions.</p> <p>To construct a fear of the heart, focus on a social interaction and what would happen if something went wrong. For instance: \u00a0 Rejection \u00a0 Intimacy \u00a0 Loneliness \u00a0 Personal awkwardness \u00a0 Loss \u00a0 Social pressures to succeed</p>"},{"location":"1.%20Start%20Here/Backstory%20Questions/#the-beast","title":"The Beast","text":"<p>Despite being abstract, the beast is probably the most commonly represented fear in storytelling.

It is easy to play a character who fears a specific type of monster. Almost every creature found in amonster manual, or bestiary, is individually terrifying, and it is easy to empathize with a character who sees monsters that way. The beast is also a central aspect of cosmic horror, where forbidden truths unravel stable aspects of reality to make our world unstable and unsafe. There is also an element of the beast in the fears that drive hatred and bigotry. Those who are ignorant and fear what they do not understand are in thrall to the beast.</p> <p>To construct a fear of the beast, think of what your character does not know and find a way to make that dangerous. Focus on the alien and outwardly horrific to find the shape of the beast.

I'm determined to make them proud. Devastation Someone once destroyed everything I cared about. I can't understand what could drive someone to such evil. Devotion I love my family above all else. There's nothing I wouldn't do to protect them. Dignity People should never be used as a means to an end. I should know. Division My family was split by a bitter feud. I still hope that they'll reconcile someday. Empathy I'll never forget the sound my parents made when they learned that my sibling had died. Faith I know what it's like to be persecuted for what you believe in. I never let it shake my beliefs. Forgiveness Someone once did me great harm. It was only much later that I learned to forgive them. Gratitude Someone took me in when I had no one else to turn to. I'll always be grateful. Hope I lost someone close to me to addiction and vice. I still hope that they'll get better someday. Humility I've seen what happens when people think they have all the answers. It never turns out well. Judgment I've seen people cause great harm in the name of faith. They laughed when I called it a sin. Loss One of my loved ones was stolen away from me. I'm still searching for them. Loyalty Someone close to me fell onto a dark path. I'd do anything to redeem them. Nostalgia One of my parents loved to create things. Their work always brought me joy. Oppression A cruel lord once ruled my community. I'll never forgive the harms he caused to my people. Regret I once knew someone with grand, ambitious plans. I wish they'd heeded my advice. Responsibility I watched someone allow their family to come to ruin. I'll never do the same. Romance Love never dies. It might flicker, but I'll never let it burn out.

For your inspiration, please see the attached flaw and bond tables for a sense of what kind of characters would work well within the campaign.</li> <li>Additionally, I highly encourage you to pick a motivation for your character from the attached motivation table and adapt it for your character idea. You may instead come up with your own internal motivation for your character that is not included in the table. I would highly prefer that each player picks a different motivation for the best campaign experience.</li> <li>Should you wish (and both parties agree), you may have bonds with some of the other characters joining the campaign before it starts.</li> <li>You are encouraged to ask any other mechanical or backstory questions and I am more than happy to help guide you towards a character that will fit in well with the campaign.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"1.%20Start%20Here/Character%20Creation%20Primer/#character-creation-primer","title":"Character Creation Primer","text":"<p>Character creation is an important aspect of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, but creating a compelling character and backstory can be difficult.

Here even strangers are given hospitality and fallen foes are extended mercy if they ask for it, since it is recognised that humanity must to some extent work together against the bitter cold and unforgiving wilderness.</p> <p>A character with a barbaric code of honour will: - Respect alliances with other honourable characters. - Ignore an alliance with a dishonourable character, even pre-emptively, if it suits him. - Abide loyally by a contract of employment, even with a dishonourable employer, so long as the character is well-treated and shown loyalty in return. - Slay a dishonourable foe, even if that foe is helpless. - Slay an honourable foe who is not helpless. - Protect those weaker than himself, at least from physical dangers, if such protection is requested. This includes ordinary folk such as peasants captured for interrogation who will be set free once it is safe to do so and rewarded if they were of assistance, as well as children and most women. A woman who has demonstrated herself to be more capable in war than the average man need not be protected, though the typical male with a barbaric code of honour will probably attempt to protect her anyway. - Offer his allegiance only to an honourable leader who is clearly stronger and better suited for power than himself, or to a greater cause of some kind; once allegiance is granted, the character must be utterly loyal so long as his leader remains honourable and loyal to him in return. Note that a character with a barbaric code of honour need not necessarily retain an allegiance that was always intended to be temporary, such as a mercenary contract, after its conditions are fulfilled. - Plunder and rob anyone other than honourable allies. - Lie, cheat and con anyone other than honourable allies. - Have no in-principle objection to slavery, being willing to keep or free slaves as suits his purposes. - Grudgingly respect genuine piety but despise venal priests and the typical trappings of civilised \u2018religion.\u2019 - Like or dislike others based on their honour and their actions, not their religion or race. - Be hospitable and generous to those in need, even to strangers. It is said that no man starves in Cimmeria unless there is a famine and all starve, because every family will give of their own food to anyone without. - Respect the hospitality shown him. - Avenge any seriously intended insult with immediate and lethal force, if at all possible. Note that barbarians new to civilisation are likely to avenge even a jesting insult in the same way, not having yet learnt the subtleties of civilised behaviour, which can allow a man to insult another without the imminent danger of having his skull split. - Avenge any physical harm done him at his earliest opportunity in a manner fitting his sense of balance and justice.</p> <p>A character with a barbaric code of honour will not: - Slay a wild animal or any other creature for sport alone.

Each Character must start with at least one Complication. A player may invent their own Complication or choose one from the following list.</p> d20 Complication 1 Loner: Your trust is not easily earned. Even those you do trust, you never trust completely. You think everyone should be able to take care of themselves; if they can\u2019t, it\u2019s their own fault. You often have trouble saying thanks.This characters suffers from a fundamental lack of trust in others, and will in a crisis seek to keep knowledge to themselves, keep away from others, and trust no one. 2 Cowardly: If things are going south, you\u2019re likely to save yourself. Even if you care for your companions, the fear for your own life is greater. Even if you\u2019re a fighter, you\u2019d rather slit a man\u2019s throat than risk a fair fight.As things turn against the character, they do not stand fast. Rather, they are prepared to change their convictions, serve those who are stronger, and abandon those who rely upon them. 3 Greedy: You cannot resist the temptation of wealth or power. You will do terrible things for gold or valuables, even at great risk. You believe that coins or station can afford you happiness, and you\u2019re willing to pay whatever price it takes to get them.By accumulating worldly goods, this character seeks safety and power. When they are overcome by this, their lust for valuables will overtake any rational impulse. 4 Troubled: You are haunted by memories of war, violence, or other trauma. You often have nightmares, replaying past events. Sometimes you experience flashbacks, triggered when presented with similar situations or placed under duress.This character withdraws from all emotion and engagement as they get stressed, becoming cold and distant as they seek to take no part in anything. 5 Arrogant: You are always right. Everyone else is beneath you. You\u2019ve been told your pride will be your undoing, but you are confident in your abilities.The haughty character expects to be obeyed and respected, and as their situation gets more precarious they will become positively tyrannical, barking orders and demanding compliance. 6 Thieving: You cannot help but take loose coins and precious things that catch your eye. It\u2019s not avarice, it\u2019s that you just have to take it. You steal for the rush; it is compulsive.By accumulating worldly goods, this character seeks safety and power. When they are overcome by this, their lust for valuables will overtake any rational impulse. 7 Drunk: You\u2019d always like a drink, and a drink always makes you want another. Seldom without cup in hand, or wineskin at your belt, you need to be drinking. It helps you sleep, or forget, or remember.This character seeks refuge in earthly pleasure, seeking to dull their minds against pain and sorrow by drunkenness. 8 Resentful: You grow bitter at perceived slights. You remember all wrongs against you and allow them to fester in your heart. Everything is meant personally and that is how you take it.Vengeful characters perceives every injustice as caused by someone, and stress will cause them to lash out and seek to harm anyone they can consider responsible for the situation. 9 Wrathful: You are quick to anger. Insult and frustration add fuel to your simmering temper. You lash out verbally or violently at perceived provocation.The more stressed they become, the more will this character delight in causing pain, from unkind words as their companions falter, to torments visited upon their enemies. 10 Lustful: You have a weakness for carnal pleasures. If you find someone attractive, they have immediate power over you. Perhaps there is a particular brand of this vice you desire most of all.This character seeks refuge in earthly pleasure, seeking to dull their minds against pain and sorrow by lechery. 11 Loose Tongued: You often say what you feel even when it is not appropriate. Perhaps you are too clever for your own good, a cynic with a sharp tongue, or an innocent fool oblivious to your blunders.Untruths are a way of creating an armour against an unkind world for this character, who will tend to exaggerate and outright lie in order to conceal facts, gain benefits, or just make themselves more interesting. 12 Intolerant: You are strongly partial to your own creed and intolerant of others. You favor those who appear similar to you almost as much as you dislike those who do not.Some idea or cause provides this character with meaning, and the worse things get, the more they will double down on it and seek to remove all threats to it. 13 Fanatic: You have excessive zeal for a particular subject. Perhaps you are extremely religious, or unshakably devoted to a leader or cause. The ends always justify vicious means. Sometimes you do things for your group that they wouldn\u2019t agree with, but you do it for their own good.Some idea or cause provides this character with meaning, and the worse things get, the more they will double down on it and seek to remove all threats to it. 14 Rebellious: You cannot help but flout authority. You\u2019ll break a law or disobey an order just for the sake of it. You instantly dislike those who command a higher station than yourself.Thinking about things only brings distress and uncertainty, so it\u2019s better to act upon impulses and follow your whims, as this character is wont to do when in danger. 15 Gruff: You have coarse manners and a lack of social graces. You seem to have a knack for committing social blunders and landing yourself in awkward or downright hostile situations.The more stressed they become, the more will this character delight in causing pain, from unkind words as their companions falter, to torments visited upon their enemies. 16 Heroic: You have a desire to save everyone and always do right. You will always risk your own life or put yourself at risk for the sake of others. You wouldn't kill a defenseless foe, even if it proved wise or prudent.A memorable death is the only true sign of a life well lived, so this character seeks to plunge themselves into worthy danger in order to prove their value. 17 Gambling: You love to take risks, gamble, and can\u2019t resist a challenge. You never back down from a wager, no matter the odds. Be it literal dice and bets or daredevil risks, you live to beat the odds.This character seeks refuge in earthly pleasure, seeking to dull their minds against pain and sorrow by other vices. 18 Guilty: You blame yourself for everything even when it\u2019s not your fault. Every death or injury of those around you weighs on your conscience.This character withdraws from all emotion and engagement as they get stressed, becoming cold and distant as they seek to take no part in anything. 19 Childish: You are whimsical or naive, a poor judge of character and wont to be taken advantage of. Others may not take you seriously, viewing you as puerile or simpleminded, but you simply experience the world in a different way.Thinking about things only brings distress and uncertainty, so it\u2019s better to act upon impulses and follow your whims, as this character is wont to do when in danger. 20 Lawful: You have a creed you live by, a Code of Honor you never stray from. Any violator of your precepts, no matter how close to you, is not above the code.A memorable death is the only true sign of a life well lived, so this character seeks to plunge themselves into worthy danger in order to prove their value. <p>Adapted From Blood and Bone - Arcana Games</p>"},{"location":"1.%20Start%20Here/Flaw/","title":"Flaws","text":"<p>Your players can choose one or more flaws from the table below to add a dash of darkness to their characters' stories.

You\u2019re in for a fantastic time. With that said, here are a few protips to succeeding in the course of this campaign:</p> <ul> <li>Intrepid adventurers and sadistic murderhobos don\u2019t last long in Barovia. Don\u2019t tread from the beaten path unless you have good reason to, and don\u2019t alienate or antagonize NPCs if you can avoid it. Make more friends than enemies. Don\u2019t go searching for treasure, fortune, or fame - because you\u00a0will\u00a0probably die a horrible death.</li> <li>Remember that you are not your character, and invest real time in developing their thoughts, personality, and motivation. Externalize failure, and use setbacks or defeat as an opportunity to explore your character\u2019s perspective and personal growth.</li> <li>Play smart. Many of the enemies in this adventure cannot be overcome easily in direct combat. Use guile, preparation, subterfuge, diplomacy, and research to achieve your goals.</li> <li>Spend time engaging with the other characters, even when not discussing plans, tactics, or objectives. Learn about their fears, their perspectives, and their experiences. Build meaningful relationships, not apathetic battle teams.</li> <li>Outside goals are hard (if not impossible) to achieve in Barovia. It's worth working with your DM to create a character driven to Barovia for some purpose that can only be fulfilled within its borders. Make sure to speak with your DM about how to shape your backstory into something that can be relevant in the world of Barovia.</li> <li>Try to remove yourself from the \u201cXP and loot\u201d model of progression in traditional campaigns and video games, and instead try to enjoy the narrative progression of winning allies, fulfilling objectives, and advancing the story of the campaign and player characters.</li> <li>Don't try to play an apathetic or evil player character\u00a0unless you are 100% sure that you can pull it off while being a supportive team player and engaging the story like a normal PC. Seriously. You'll make this adventure a lot more difficult and unenjoyable for your DM, and you'll be cheating yourself out of a fun experience.

Since the arrival of the Ambrians, changelings have started to emerge among them as well. While a rare occurrence, it is still a traumatic experience for every family affected. It is unknown what exact purpose the elves have for doing this, but Ordo Magica\u2019s catalog of known cases in Ambria implies that children have been taken throughout the entire population, literally from both high and low.</p> <p>A changeling looks human during childhood and starts to develop more elf-\u00adlike features in their adolescent years, though without ever becoming an elf in the true sense of the word. A changeling reaches adulthood at approximately the same age as a human; the changeling then continues to live a long life but apparently without taking any further steps in the life-\u00adcycle of the elves. This has made some scholars develop theories stating that changelings are a people of their own, created by elven magic. Others claim that changelings indeed are elf-\u00adspawn but that their natural life-\u00adcycle has been truncated in some mystical way by growing up among humans.</p> <p>A changeling\u2019s lot in life is usually a hard one, since few of them are allowed to stay with their families when their true nature has been revealed. Changelings are sometimes taken in by witches or wizards to serve as assistants, but most of them end up on the street where they have to fend for themselves as best they can. Exiled from human society, the changeling wanders a long and lonely road, often bitter and dark minded, in other cases frivolous and indifferent to the hardship of others.</p> CHANGELING TRAITS <p>As changeling youngsters grow up, their elven nature is gradually revealed.</p> <ul> <li>Ability Score Increase.\u00a0Your Wisdom score increases by 2. Increase any other ability score by 1.</li> <li>Age.\u00a0By their 20th year changelings no longer resemble humans at all. Unless struck down by violence, they can live for centuries.</li> <li>Size.\u00a0Changelings seem to be of the same size as elves, usually at least five feet tall but rarely reaching six feet. Your size is Medium and you have a d8 Hit Die. At first level you have 8 hit points plus your Constitution modifier. When you gain a level in any class, you gain an additional Hit Die and if using the average value, use 5 on even levels and 4 on odd (1d8) plus your Constitution modifier hit points.</li> <li>Speed.\u00a0Your base walking speed is 30\u00a0feet.</li> <li>Darkvision.\u00a0You inherit your true parents\u2019 ability to see in dim light. You can see in dim light as if it were normal light. In complete darkness, you rely on your other senses to give you blindsight within 10 feet. You never receive disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks due to darkness.</li> <li>Shapeshifting.\u00a0You are eligible to take the Change Self feat if your group allows feats. If so, you can take the feat instead of an ability score improvement.</li> <li>Languages.\u00a0Changelings usually speak the local human language, either Ambrian or Barbarian. Some near Davokar speak the language of elves as well.</li> </ul> CHANGELING NAMES <p>Some changelings choose elven names when they are thrown out into the street or left in the forest, maybe in an attempt to reclaim a lost identity. Others \u2013 like the infamous gutter mage Grimorio Abramelin in Yndaros \u2013 take a new and often bombastic name as a defiant gesture or an expression of independence.</p> <ul> <li>Changeling male names:\u00a0Aka, Ardri, Ene\u00e1no, Feon, Ganderald, Goriol, Ibliglin, Kalfu, Radomaramei, Sinue.</li> <li>Changeling female names:\u00a0Bekora, Danive, Yelo\u00e9na, Elorinda, Hin\u00e9ua, Kinlegelana, Riamata, Roha, Seanua, Varaneia.</li> </ul> Changeling Backgrounds <p>The following backgrounds represent some of the most likely fates for changelings once they are discovered to be inhuman in nature.</p> Broken Home <p>When you were revealed to be a changeling it tore your family apart.

I am forever bound to this person. 2 One of my \u2018human family\u2019 did not give up on me even when my true heritage was revealed. 3 I seek the elf who swapped me for who I should have been. I will demand an explanation. 4 I am a dedicated member of one of the world\u2019s factions; I cannot imagine living without them. 5 Somewhere out there is a human who\u2019s childhood I\u00a0lived. We must meet to become whole. 6 I am sworn to help and protect changelings everywhere. 1d6 FLAW 1 I don\u2019t really trust anyone, and I assume they will leave me when I need them most. 2 I\u2019ve always felt different and special, now I know why. 3 Humans are no longer worth my time. 4 I despise elves and enjoy seeing them struggle. 5 I abandoned my earlier \u201cfriends,\u201d and they are now out to get me. 6 I am envious of those who have more than me in life. Mage\u2019s Assistant <p>You were very fortunate \u2013 most changelings are subject to ridicule and rejection as they grow up, but at the first signs of your inner nature a mystic visited your family and convinced them to allow you to apprentice with them.

Your Corruption Threshold is 1 higher than it would be otherwise.</p> Suggested Characteristics <p>Though most of your training time was spent inside, away from curious eyes, you are still awkward when meeting others or trying to convince them of your sincerity and dedication.</p> 1d8 PERSONALITY TRAIT 1 I seek out the company of mystics whenever I can. 2 I chose the opposing view in discussions, just to make it more interesting. 3 I keep my knowledge to myself, unless it\u2019s needed for survival. 4 I share my magical insights with everyone, whether they ask for it or not. 5 If a problem can be solved by using magic, I will use magic. 6 I am careful to only use magic when it is really needed, preferring mundane methods if at all possible. 7 I keep a bug out bag nearby at all times, always prepared to run. I talk too loud and stand too close to people when I do it. Feels perfectly normal to me. 8 I can\u2019t keep my mind on the topic at hand, I always find a more interesting tangent to explore. 1d6 IDEAL 1 Study.\u00a0Nothing about my personal history matters, only learning more magic. 2 Purity.\u00a0I must keep my body and soul free from Corruption. 3 Fight fire with fire.\u00a0Corruption is a gift, we must use it to win. 4 Power.\u00a0With enough magic I can do whatever I want, and no one can stop me. 5 Common good.\u00a0Magic should be used to better society for all. 6 Legacy.\u00a0I will transmit all I have learned to the next generation. 1d6 BOND 1 The mystic who brought me here saved my life. 2 I feel a calling towards the forest, despite my fears. 3 I carry something from my childhood, to remind me of simpler days. 4 I feel a connection with magic itself, more important than any person. 5 I have a tome of study that I always keep within me \u2013 it changed my whole worldview. 6 I remember my \u2018sibling\u2019 weeping when my nature was discovered. I keep that memory forever. 1d6 FLAW 1 I deserve an explanation for my life, even if it must be written in blood. 2 I know magic will be the end of me, but I can\u2019t stop longing for more of it. 3 I am caught between human and elven ways and will never feel at home. 4 When people call me names, I am tempted to believe them. 5 I want to grow so strong in magic that no one dares question me. 6 I am superior to humanity and that is why they are afraid of me."},{"location":"2.%20Origins/Dwarves/","title":"Dwarves","text":"<p>THE SHORT AND wiry people humans call dwarves have a history shrouded in mystery. Looking at the dwarves settled in Yndaros, they display no interest in the history of their kind; they are a people on the move, aimed towards the future, fleeing a dark past that has given them a sense of community, but without peace or meaning. The dwarven perspective is rooted in the sanctity of the family, the secrets of the spoken word and the conviction that the world is their common enemy. Gamalga of Kadizar, a sage interested in dwarves, is said to have stated that: \u201cThe family is their shield, the language their weapon and the world their battlefield.\u201d</p> <p>Gamalga also spoke of the origin of the dwarves. After many fruitless conversations with the dwarves in Yndaros and at the fortress Ku\u0308am Zamok, Gamalga realized that she would get better answers from elves and trolls, and that they claimed to have never met dwarves before the fall of Symbaroum. They were most likely created in the old empire and Gamalga summarizes her meager findings as follows:</p> <p>\u201cThey emerged as worms in the rotting carcass of the World Serpent and were given wit by Symbaroum\u2019s sorcerers, to make them better slaves. However, the birth of the people forever bound them to the world and its fate, and because of this bond they early on developed a forceful counterculture which still marks them. The ancestral mothers and fathers of the dwarves created a language with hidden codes and secret double-\u00admeanings, so intricate that not even the masters could understand. The dwarves never wrote anything down, since texts could be read, interpreted and even decoded by the lords of Symbaroum. The dwarves kept their dreams to themselves and their voices echoed with the fate of the world.</p> <p>Elves confirm that there is power inherent in some dwarven speech, and imply that those who made the dwarves, Symbaroum\u2019s princes, in time learned to hate their creations and fear the power contained in their language. After the fall of Symbaroum, the chronicle of the dwarven people describes an arduous journey in the shadow of death, continuously attacked and hunted by others. Nowadays, the descendants of the few who survived Symbaroum\u2019s ruin have spread to many places and their fates are seemingly very different.</p> <p>Apparently, the families in Yndaros are members of a once ruling elite in Ku\u0308am Zamok, cast out after a bloody revolution \u2013 hence, the organized villains encountered in Ambria\u2019s capital are in fact dwarven nobles, used to ruling and giving orders, but incapable of creating even the most essential items themselves. More dubious scraps of information say that their inability to get along has to do with the order of succession in the realm they left behind, and the right to a throne which none of them will ever conquer.\u201d</p> <p>The people of Ambria have formed their opinions based on the dwarves in Yndaros, and they are not a very welcoming sort. They demand nothing of others, other than being allowed to mind their own business. To dwarves, the will of the family \u2013 as interpreted by the elders \u2013 is superior to the will of the individual, meaning that they often appear to have two sets of moral standards: one strictly coded and aimed at the family; another aimed at outsiders and often described as \u201ca lack of morality\u201d by their neighbors \u2013 since actions which only affect outsiders have no bearing on the internal family relations.</p> <p>The speech of the Yndarian dwarves is still today so intricate and filled with codes, double-\u00admeanings and obscure idioms that their everyday conversations are close to unintelligible to bystanders, no matter how learned. It is also true that their voices have a particular power that some individuals know to make use of. Furthermore, their memory-\u00adtechniques are highly developed, making it possible for them to run complex \u201cbusinesses\u201d in Yndaros without writing down a single number or word.</p> <p>DWARF TRAITS</p> <p>All dwarves encountered in Yndaros seem to have much in common.</p> <ul> <li>Ability Score Increase.\u00a0Your Intelligence score increases by 2. Increase two other ability scores by 1.</li> <li>Age.\u00a0The dwarven life-\u00adcycle is not well known, but it seems that dwarves are allowed their independence by their second or third decade of life and remain active for at least a century.</li> <li>Size.\u00a0Dwarves range from four to five feet in height and are solidly built but not stocky. Your size is Medium and you have a d8 Hit Die. At first level you have 8 hit points plus your Constitution modifier. When you gain a level in any class, you gain an additional Hit Die and if using the average value, use 5 on even levels and 4 on odd (1d8) plus your Constitution modifier hit points.</li> <li>Speed.\u00a0Dwarven legs do not permit the long strides of other folk. You have a base speed of 25\u00a0feet.</li> <li>Absolute Memory.\u00a0Dwarven memory is robust and comprehensive. They can remember anything they choose to commit to memory at any time and can remember even incidental events up to a month after they occur.</li> <li>Earth Bound.\u00a0Dwarves are bound to the bones of the world. They have no soul \u2013 instead your current Corruption total reduces your current and maximum hit points on a 1:1 basis. You do not roll for marks of Corruption and if your total Corruption equals or exceeds your current hit points you become unconscious until your Corruption is reduced or your hit points increase (an unconscious dwarf counts as taking a short or longer rest if they are undisturbed). If you acquire more permanent Corruption than your Corruption Threshold (see ) then your character is no longer playable. If slain, they cannot become undead or be resurrected. Even speak with dead fails.</li> <li>Pariahs.\u00a0Dwarves are poorly understood or tolerated among other peoples. They have disadvantage on social checks with everyone other than fellow dwarves, elves and trolls.</li> <li>Languages.\u00a0Dwarves usually speak the local human language, either Ambrian or Barbarian, but with much more sophistication, adding in a series of code words that enable two dwarves to have a secret conversation in public. Some near Davokar speak the language of trolls or elves as well.</li> </ul> <p>DWARF NAMES</p> <p>Judging by the dwarves living in Yndaros, they have a fondness for names which contain many hard consonants, such as k, t and r. Aside from that, there seems to be no difference between male and female names: they are inherited within the family and between generations without concern for gender. All dwarves also have family surnames, just like the Ambrian nobles. However, it appears as if younger dwarves must earn the right to call themselves by their family name, preferably by impressing their relatives and making them proud.</p> <ul> <li>Dwarf Names:\u00a0Artek, Bolkor, Brana, Dobril, Dranek, Dusa, Jarok, Lazek, Margor, Mirek, Radmil, Stana, Vesnek, Vlador, Yaruk</li> </ul> <p>Dwarf Backgrounds</p> <p>Dwarves who choose or are forced to leave their families in Yndaros are lonely and often dangerous individuals. However, for some dwarves, the seclusion becomes the start of the search for a new family, defined by other characteristics than blood. The following reasons may explain why you have left Yndaros to head out into the world.</p> <p>Dreams of Doom</p> <p>You are haunted by nightmares of doom and death, for your family or the world as a whole. You have left the community to become a seeker, hoping to determine the meaning of your dreams and, ideally, learn how to avert the disaster and protect all your loved-\u00adones.</p> <ul> <li>Skill Proficiencies:\u00a0Insight</li> <li>Tool Proficiencies (choose one):\u00a0Any set of tools</li> <li>Equipment:\u00a0A kit to match your tool proficiency, simple clothes and 4d6 + 1 shillings.</li> </ul> <p>Feature: Haunted</p> <p>Your nightmares are sometimes prophetic. When you complete a long rest you gain a prophecy die, a d6. Before making a skill check, you can declare that something about the situation reminds you of your dreams and add the d6 to the roll. You must do this before the GM declares the check a success or failure. You recover the die with a long or extended rest.</p> <p>Suggested Characteristics</p> <p>Constantly harried by terrible visions, these dwarves have cut almost all family ties.

The tribe that left the darkness of Davokar to settle down close to Thistle Hold swarms and makes such a racket that they have made themselves quite unpopular among the town\u2019s human populace. Their fiery temperament and strange ways of socializing have contributed to the disapproval: \u201cHide the Boot\u201d, \u201cTame the Ogre\u201d, \u201cTrim the Thistle\u201d, \u201cTighten the Temple\u201d and \u201cWant a Smack, Molok?\u201d are party games that outsiders are reluctant to even watch.</p> <p>The life of a goblin is short \u2013 a goblin is considered a youngster at the age of five, adult at ten and an elder at the age of twenty. To meet a thirty-\u00adyear-\u00adold goblin is a rarity, as most of them voluntarily return to seek a lonesome death in Davokar before then. Meeting one who is forty is all but unheard of. The truth of the goblin life-\u00adcycle is even more remarkable, though few humans know it \u2013 when goblins feel the pull of the forest not all of them die. Some are changed, becoming trolls or ogres.</p> <p>The only reason why goblins are tolerated in Thistle Hold is that they are practical when it comes to doing dirty work like draining marshes, emptying latrines and flailing about on scaffolding. Thanks to that, a gibbering horde of sinewy goblins flows into the town every morning to work hard at a number of heavy, dangerous or thankless tasks. Come nightfall, they are once again driven away, and a bunch of uncharacteristically silent goblins march back to their beds in simple huts of straw and clay.</p> <p>Some goblins stray from this pattern, mainly treasure-\u00adhunters and goblins employed in the households of wealthy individuals in Thistle Hold. A dozen or so goblin younglings can also be found in the convent school in the capital city, where a handful of extremely patient monks have committed themselves to saving whatever soul resides inside the wild whelps.

Queen Korinthia\u2019s claim to Ambria, the land south of Davokar forest, is motivated by her ancestral connection to the region, and even the most novice of Ambrian linguists can explain in what ways the \u201cgibbering speech of the barbarians and the melodious tongue of the Queen\u2019s Folk are similar.\u201d More disputed are claims saying that the two peoples originate from the same stem, rooted in the old and long forgotten empire of Symbaroum whose ruins are hidden deep within Davokar.</p> <p>Whatever the case, there are significant differences between the two peoples in a cultural sense. The Ambrians abandoned their blighted homeland Alberetor twenty years ago, to settle down in the well-\u00adpreserved ruins of Lindaros. On their journey they brought along their architecture, knowledge, economic system and social hierarchies. Thanks to its discipline the Ambrian army outmatches the barbarian clan warriors when they meet in the open fields, but in the woods where the skill of the individual becomes a decisive factor they are more evenly matched. That, coupled with the advantage of having greater local knowledge, has so far kept the Ambrians from entering very deep into the forest \u2013 with the exception of treasure-\u00adhunters, religious fanatics searching for lost sun temples and free settlers hoping to escape the Queen\u2019s control.</p> <p>Since the days of old, the barbarians have been ruled by chieftains, but enjoyed much greater independence and freedom compared to the chastened crofters and peasants in the south. Nor do the barbarian leaders seek to enforce a strict or rigid way of life upon their subjects. The witches, the spiritual leaders among the barbarians, rule with a light hand in the form of taboos and general rules \u2013 revere nature, never abuse it and avoid the darker parts of the forest. The clans lead their lives independent from one another, with the occasional exception of skirmishes over resources in the border regions. By tradition, the clan leaders answer to the High Chieftain on the plateau of Karvosti, but he is in reality more of an arbitrator between feuding clans than a strong ruler. However, the High Chieftain is expected to lead the united barbarians to repel any invaders, particularly the Ambrians, if it ever comes to open war.</p> <p>This possibility, a united barbarian resistance commanded by the High Chieftain, gives the Queen and her advisors nightmares, and would explain why the Ambrians officially are so cautious regarding Davokar. Since the battle in Year\u00a010, when Korinthia\u2019s troops attacked and destroyed Haloban and his Jezites, only the Templars serving the Sun Church have made any outright attacks against barbarian settlements. Most infamous is their assault on Karvosti in Year 16 when they attempted to seize the plateau with force of arms \u2013 an attempt which ended in a discouraging defeat.</p>"},{"location":"2.%20Origins/Humans/#human-traits","title":"HUMAN TRAITS","text":"<p>All of human origin start with the same basic features and then select a culture: either Ambrian or Barbarian.</p> <ul> <li>Ability Score Increase.\u00a0Your Strength score increases by\u00a02.

It is up to the humans or goblins who eventually take them in to give them a name and teach them the ways of the world.</p> <p>The tales told of ogres vary from being hilarious to horrific. What is known is that the witches of Davokar sometimes take ogres under their wing and raise them to be guards and servants. Explorers have also reported that an Ambrian outpost near the Black Pitch Mire has adopted an ogre called Armstout and the soldiers there have the giant dig ditches, lift heavy equipment and draw the plow from time to time. A similar phenomenon is the ogres that are snatched by goblin gangs in the slums of Yndaros to serve as heavy-\u00adhanded enforcers.</p> <p>In southern Davokar they tell of the companions Deterror and Vitrona, the latter a skillful scout employed by the witches and the former a huge ogre and the scout\u2019s best friend. Word of the duo has also reached Thistle Hold where they have become the subjects of a series of popular songs, supposedly recounting their adventures in the ruins of Symbaroum.</p> <p>OGRE TRAITS</p> <p>Though they do not realize it, all ogres share a common origin and have many more similarities than differences despite their varied upbringings.</p> <ul> <li>Ability Score Increase.\u00a0Your Constitution score increases by 2. Increase any other ability score by 1.</li> <li>Age.\u00a0Ogres have no sense of their \u2018birth\u2019 and it is up to other people to keep track of their age in whatever way they see fit. The general consensus is that ogres can live for several decades at least, and at least one ogre is known to have reached 100 years of service to the witches, plus however many years spent wandering in the wild before that.</li> <li>Size.\u00a0Ogres tend to be from 7 to 8\u00a0feet tall and weigh from 250 to 350 pounds. Your size is Medium and you have a d8 Hit Die. At first level you have 9 hit points plus your Constitution modifier. When you gain a level in any class, you gain an additional Hit Die and 6 (1d8) plus your Constitution modifier hit points (see below).</li> <li>Speed.\u00a0Ogres have long limbs and an incautious attitude, your base speed is 40\u00a0feet.</li> <li>Darkvision.\u00a0Accustomed to the gloom of Davokar, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light as if it were normal light. In complete darkness, you rely on your other senses to give you blindsight within 10 feet. You never receive disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks due to darkness.</li> <li>Pariahs.\u00a0Ogres are often poorly treated in society and have disadvantage on Charisma checks with other peoples. However, they tend to do well with goblins and make normal Charisma checks when interacting with them.</li> <li>Calmness.\u00a0Ogres are slow to speak, slow to take offense and are possessed by a deep mental placidity. You have advantage on Wisdom saving throws against enchantments and other mind-\u00adaltering magics.</li> <li>Tough Skin. Ogres can withstand more hurt than most other creatures. At first level you gain an additional hit point. When rolling for hit points, roll the Hit Die twice and use the higher result. If using the average result, use 6.</li> <li>Languages.\u00a0Ogres speak the language of whomever adopted them.</li> </ul> <p>OGRE NAMES</p> <p>Ogres seem to lack any given names and are therefore nicknamed by people around them.

A rune staff is an expression of the Staff Mage\u2019s strength as well as a powerful weapon \u2013 something that has led to some Wizards of Ordo Magica calling them by degrading names like \u201cwand-\u00adthrowers\u201d or \u201cbroomsticks.\u201d To the Staff Mage, the staff is an extension of their soul and to experienced staff mages it may sometimes be difficult to tell where the mage ends and the staff begins; they are part of the same whole.</p> <p>Whatever you call them, Staff Mages are said to descend from an order of warrior monks, tasked with protecting Symbaroum\u2019s last emperor. After the fall of Symbaroum, they withdrew to their castle deep inside Davokar. It was not until recent times that they became known to the people of the south; before that they only sought new recruits among the northern barbarian clans \u2013 individuals suited for an ascetic life in the shadow of death. Many of the potentials tended to be changelings.</p> <p>With the darkness spreading through Davokar, the Staff Mages have expanded their area of search to include the southerners and their realm. Hence, the plainly dressed warrior monks with their characteristic rune staffs can sometimes be seen visiting Ambria\u2019s duchies and courts, hunting for novices and allies in the fight against the horrors haunting the ruins of Davokar.</p> <p>The Order of Staff Magic consists of a number of ascetic warrior monks who see themselves as descendants to the guard of Symbaroum\u2019s last emperor. The Staff Mages live in their castle deep inside the forest, in the wild parts of Davokar where ruins from the fallen empire constantly remind them of their past failure. According to their myths, the fall of Symbaroum was directly connected to the death of the emperor, and as his bodyguards it was their duty to keep him alive. Hence, in the minds of the staff mages, the fall of Symbaroum was their doing and with the destruction of the empire, darkness entered this part of the world.</p> <p>It is up to the now living Staff Mages to correct the errors of the past, meaning that they must fight Corruption and finally resurrect the fallen empire. To fight against Corruption they use their staff to capture and bind Corruption, but there is danger in this as well. They have a valuable ally in the Iron Pact; even if the mages are not official members of the pact, they often cooperate with the elves.

Each order chapter (commonly called \u201cWizards\u2019 guild\u201d) is governed by a Chapter Master, who represents Ordo Magica when dealing with the local authorities. Ordo Magica as a whole is headed by the Grand Master, stationed at the chapter in Agrella.</p> <p>The title of Arch Mage is no longer in use. Before The Great War the Grand Master of the organization was chosen from within the circle of Arch Mages.

This instrument is particularly popular among some of the clans, but versions of it can also be found across the Ambrian countryside. However, it is never seen in Ambria\u2019s finer salons\u2026</li> <li>Brass Horn. A decent bellowing instrument for pompous situations.</li> <li>Birch-\u00adbark Horn. Commoners in the Ambrian countryside use these horns for multiple purposes, but mainly to scare away beasts and call on their livestock. The horn is also used to send messages over long distances; a lone herdsman can signal surrounding holdings from where the message is passed on. Skilled horn-\u00adblowers actually play in a unique way, so that everyone knows who is sending the message: \u201chere be baiagorn tracks,\u201d \u201ca cow is missing\u201d or \u201cgoblins have stolen my cheese.\u201d</li> <li>Drum. A rhythm instrument that comes in many forms, from the simpler drums heard among the clans of Davokar, to the metal-\u00adframed instruments of the Ambrian army.</li> <li>Fiddle. An often three-\u00adstringed instrument, played with a bow made from horsehair, very common among peasants in Ambria.</li> <li>Flute. There are innumerable kinds of flutes, from slender metal flutes to wind instruments made from reeds, tree branches and horn. Other known types are the panpipe and the Shawm, the latter identified by its shrill tone.</li> <li>Hurdy-\u00adgurdy. The hurdy-\u00adgurdy is a string-\u00adinstrument with a crank handle that gives rise to a creaking sound to rhythmically accompany the music. It has long been popular in Ambria (and Alberetor before that), but in Yndaros it has come to be associated with beggars. Many refugees from the south earn their living by constantly exposing those passing by to a cacophony of melodic droning, creaking and grinding.</li> <li>Lute. String-\u00adinstrument with a pear-\u00adshaped base, played with the fingers or a pick.</li> <li>Mouth Harp. The tiny mouth harp is carried by many daythalers, entertainers and jesters, and its sound can often be heard in the background at gatherings in Ambria\u2019s simpler environments.</li> <li>Spinet. The spinet is a fingerboard instrument (a harpsichord) which is popular in the court of Yndaros and forms the backbone of Ambrian Court Music, together with the lute.</li> </ul> <p>Navigator\u2019s Tools</p> <p>This set of instruments is used for navigation at sea.

It\u2019s like a stjorn maker, but instead of spikes, the battle mace has sharp flanges.</p> <p>Hring Seax (Ring Knife) The hring seax or ring knife is perhaps most common in Mittland. Its single-edged blade is usually slightly inward curving, and there is a ring at the end of the handle, sometimes used to tie the weapon to the wielder\u2019s wrist. The shape of the hring seax in Mittland bears strong influences from Elven weapons. In Mittland, the hring seax shows that the wielder is faithful to the Eald Tradition. A hring seax is seldom used for household activities, it is instead a weapon mainly conceived for combat.</p> <p>Klubb (Club) A klubb is one of the most common weapons among those who cannot support themselves as warriors. The klubb is cheap and easy to fight with. Primitive klubbs consist of a truncated tree branch.</p> <p>Lill Spj\u00f3t (Short Spear) The lill spj\u00f3t is cheap and easy to use for an inexperienced warrior. It can also be used for hunting if the hunter is brave enough to stand close to his prey</p> <p>Nagli Klubb (Spiked Club) A more developed variant of the klubb is the nagli klubb. Often made from wood, this club has spikes at the top to inflict more damage.</p> <p>Seax (Dagger or Knife) The seax is both a weapon and a tool that\u2019s carried by most of Trudvang\u2019s inhabitants. Seax exist in many varieties adapted for throwing, thrusting, and cutting. Some are made for hunting, fishing, and household use: these blades are usually single-edged knives. Other varieties are doubleedged daggers with sharp points, fit for piercing attacks. In the Stormlands, the Bjorn paw or bear paw is a favored weapon, and the short, broad-bladed seax carries much symbolism for Gerbanis. A knife is used for ritual Blood Gifting, and many warriors wear one on their belts as a last resort when all other weapons are lost or too heavy to lift.</p> <p>Split Axi (Hand Axe) Like the seax, the split axi is partly carried as a utility tool, and partly as a weapon if need be.</p> <p>Stafur (Staff) The stafur works both as a walking stick and as a weapon.

The slender grip and the feather-\u00adthin steel of the blade makes this weapon easy to conceal without sacrificing its bite. It is easily strapped to the wrist or ankle, or even attached behind the neck with a lump of resin. Special girdles or hidden pockets in clothes work just as well. The weapon can be smuggled past guards, to be used on secret missions or to be handed over to a prisoner.</p> <p>Axe. Preferred weapon of many barbarians.</p> <p>Bastjur Kedj\u00e1 (Troll Chain) A Bastjur kedj\u00e1 is a bigger version of the barda kl\u00f3t that can also be thrown. Some balls have studs or long spikes. Fighting with this weapon is tough and requires much skill, but its force is good against shields and in spaces where the ball has the potential to hit with full power.</p> <p>Chain Staff. The chain staff was developed by elves and has been adopted by some barbarian clans. The weapon is composed of a staff with a short chain attached to each end, making it possible to use the weapon to ensnare a target. The chains often end in a weight or a short blade, making it even more deadly.</p> <p>Crow\u2019s Beak A less elegant, but still effective weapon is the crow\u2019s beak, also known as a Kandorian war pick after the city in Alberetor where it was first forged. The crow\u2019s beak is a club whose metal head is fitted with a spike or a beak of steel, in order to punch through armor more easily. After the escape to Yndaros, the smiths of the Kandorian war pick settled down in the district of Old Kadizar where they have continued to craft their dreaded weapons.</p> <p>Double-\u00adaxe. The barbarian double-\u00adaxe (not to be confused with the more common pole axe with its single-\u00adedged axe head) is aptly named after its twin axe heads and is presumed to be a legacy from the fallen Symbaroum. In those days the double-\u00adaxe was a weapon as well as a symbol of status and standing. Even though the knowledge of metallurgy has dwindled since the fall of Symbaroum these powerful weapons can still be forged, often made for particularly prominent warriors. Ambrians consider the double-\u00adaxe crude and savage, fit for barbarians and few else, but its shape is well known because of its similarity to the royal rune, Labrys.</p> <p>Estoc. This is a fencing sword but with a tapered blade that ends in a wedge-\u00adshaped tip, intended to penetrate the target\u2019s armor.</p> <p>Fencing Sword. In Yndaros, the Ambrian fencing sword is considered to be of the highest fashion, an instrument with superior precision made from strong but flexible steel. It is often combined with the duelist\u2019s favorite, the parrying dagger, which gives the lightly armored fighter a stronger defense in combat.</p> <p>Barda Faldir (Battle Flail) The barda faldir is predominantly used by the warriors of the Tenets of Nid. It\u2019s a combat version of the flails that are used for farming. The barda faldir often has a wooden shaft, a chain, and an oblong head with spikes.</p> <p>Villtur Axi (Bearded Axe) The blade of this axe is L-shaped in order to widen the cutting surface without augmenting the weight. The villtur axi is the battle axe that the Stormlanders prefer, notably the rangers. It is also used sparingly by the Viranns, but not that often by the Mittlanders, who think it to be too unwieldy. With its long shaft, the villtur axi is sometimes longer than the barda axi but smaller than the tvei axi. A strong and big wielder may be able to learn to use it with one hand.</p> <p>Tvei Faldir (Two-Handed Flail) The tvei feldir resembles the regular barda faldir except that it has a significantly longer shaft and striking head.</p> <p>Tvei swerd (Greatsword). This double-\u00adhanded blade is the weapon of choice for some of the most famous knights of Ambria.</p> <p>Breid Spj\u00f3t (Broad-bladed Spear) The breid spj\u00f3t, or hoggvaspear (hewing spear) or pole blade, as it also is called, is most common in Mittland. It consists of a long wooden shaft and a tip that resembles a seax, or even a short sword. There are variants with a curved edge, but those are most common among the Arks. The length varies between that of a lill spj\u00f3t and a spj\u00f3t but is seldom longer than 7 feet. The main advantage of this weapon is long reach combined with the possibility of making not just piercing but also slashing and chopping attacks</p> <p>Lance. The value of this weapon should not be underestimated \u2013 the largest monstrosities of the Dark Lords were often slain by lances in the hands of brave knights. The weapon was also used by the Ambrian cavalry to gain dominance over the lowlands and drive barbarians, packs of predators and abominations into the forest of Davokar.</p> <p>Barda Hammri (Battle Hammer) The barda hammri is developed from a regular blacksmith hammer, though it sometimes can be hard to tell them apart. The barda hammri often has a wooden handle and a big iron head. Some barda hammris have studs or nails on one side of the head</p> <p>Stakk Swerd (Long Sword) The stakk swerd has a long, double-edged blade. Often the blade is narrow and relatively thin, making it a weapon capable of being used in one hand.\u00a0 It\u2019s a good weapon for protection, and the small tip is good for working into cracks in the enemy\u2019s armor. Using the crossguard as an improvised battle hammer is common. The master smiths of the Pansars forge the finest weapons in Ambria, and the swords of the Queen\u2019s Guard are an exquisite testament to that fact, at least when wielded by the right warrior. The weapon is preferably handled with both hands but can also be used single-\u00adhandedly with a shield.</p> <p>Maul. This weapon is a long-\u00adhandled hammer with a heavy head of wood, lead, or iron.</p> <p>Parrying Dagger The parrying dagger, with its wide and v-\u00adshaped cross-\u00adguard, has become very popular in Yndaros, and is often wielded together with a fencing sword.</p> <p>Pike. The slender shaft and fire-\u00adtempered steel point of the Ambrian pike slides towards the target with great precision.</p> <p>Glaaf (Short Sword) A glaaf is slightly longer than the hring seax and usually has two edges. The skalm is a variant with only one sharp edge. The glaaf is most common in the eastern parts of Trudvang and it was the weapon of choice of the ancient Broths.</p> <p>Stiletto. The slender and agile stiletto is a dagger whose razor sharp point stabs deeply \u2013 the weapon of an assassin.</p> <p>Whip. This whip has been adapted from the common herding or slave-\u00addriving whip; its function is not only to drive but also to snare the target. Also, its length gives it a considerable flicking power able to wound lightly armored targets.</p>"},{"location":"5.Equipment/Weapons/#martial-ranged-weapons","title":"Martial Ranged Weapons","text":"Name Cost Damage Wt.

This is a heavy Ambrian crossbow with a bow of feather-\u00adlight steel, which gives its bolts a bit of extra punch.</p> <p>Blowpipe. The purpose of this weapon is to fire a poisoned dart towards a target. The dart deals minimal damage itself, but penetrates any protection worn on a successful hit. See for more details on poisons.</p> <p>Bolas. This weapon is used in Davokar when someone wants to capture the prey alive; or in order to slow down a target before moving in for the kill. The bolas are made of two or more weights tied together with ropes that, together, are hurled at the target\u2019s legs or arms in order to hinder movement. Normally, such a weapon is thrown at the opponent\u2019s legs and if the attack roll is successful, the target becomes prone and restrained. It is harder to hit the arms of the target \u2013 this requires an attack roll at regular range with disadvantage. On a success the target cannot use their arms. Removing the bolas requires an action to attempt a DC 13 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.</p> <p>Composite Bow. Among the wagon-\u00adriding Varaks and Saars who live on the plains west of Davokar, bow-\u00admaking is a highly esteemed art form. The composite bow is made from layers of horn and sinews over a wooden core; it is shorter and not as precise as the longbow but more powerful. Its size makes it perfect for use while on horseback, the driver\u2019s seat of a wagon or the narrow platform of a battle chariot.</p> <p>Crossbow, hand. Among the thieves and gangs of Yndaros, a smaller and more easily concealed version of the crossbow is used. It can be held and fired in one hand, but requires two to load and has nearly the same punch as the standard crossbow. Assassins often apply poison to the bolts, making the weapon very effective for its size.</p> <p>Crossbow, repeating. This is a mechanically advanced version of the crossbow. The weapon has a push lever underneath, for quicker reloading. Only the most skilled blacksmiths are able to construct such technically advanced weaponry.</p> <p>Throwing Wing.

In the depths of Davokar, throwing wings made from hardened wood are used to hunt small game, while the ones used in combat have a knife-\u00adsharp edge of steel all around the wing.A proficient user can catch a returning wing as an object interaction.</p> <p>Alchemical Weapons</p> Name Cost Damage Wt.

Any creatures within the area effect of the device must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking full damage on a failed save and half damage on a successful one. Trained users do not risk such catastrophic failures.</p> <p>Breaching Pot. This is a jar filled with volatile substances that explode when ignited or crushed. If the breaching pot has been buried close to a structure it has the siege quality; if it detonates in open air, it has an area effect instead. Note that whoever sets up a breaching pot must use a fuse to avoid suffering from the effect. Anyone can use a breaching pot but only those proficient with Alchemical Weapons can do so without risking a catastrophic failure. See the sidebar. Breaching pots can also be used as ammunition for catapults, in which case they have an area effect on impact.</p> <p>Using an Alchemical Firetube</p> <p>Firetubes have an area of effect. Instead of making an attack roll, creatures in the area of effect must make a Dexterity saving throw against a DC equal to 8 plus your proficiency bonus plus your Dexterity modifier. Creatures that succeed on the saving throw take half damage, those that fail take normal damage and are subject to any conditions until the end of their next turn.</p> <p>Firetube, portable. This is a lighter version of the stationary siege weapon with the same name.</p> <p>The portable version is made of a solid pipe, which is loaded with alchemical flammables that when ignited turn the weapon into a flamethrower. Anyone can use this weapon but see the sidebar about untrained use.</p> <p>Firetube, stationary. This weapon consists of a cylinder \u2013 usually a hollowed log, but fully cast versions also exist \u2013 which is loaded with alchemical flammables that when ignited turn the weapon into a devastating flamethrower. This device requires proficiency with alchemical weapons to use.</p> <p>Throwing Grenades</p> <p>When you throw a grenade, you can either aim for a creature, in which case the to-hit roll is against its AC, or aim for a specific spot on the ground which is AC 13. On a failure the grenade lands somewhere else: roll 1D8 for cardinal direction (1 = north, 2 = north-east, 3 = east, etc.) and 1d10 for distance in feet and explodes.</p> <p>Grenade. The alchemical grenade is the smaller cousin of the breaching pot \u2013 a sturdy ceramic vessel is filled with volatile substances that explode when ignited with a fuse or when the vessel is crushed. The grenade is fist-\u00adsized and is thrown by hand or with a sling.

Essentially, this is a massive, stationary crossbow, intended to fire at fixed targets, troop formations on the field and monsters of the most robust sort. In The Great War, the ballista was used against the undead draft beasts of the Dark Lords, with the intent of stopping their siege towers from reaching the ramparts. This continued during the colonization of Ambria, with the tame beasts of the barbarian warlords as the primary targets. Even today, ballistae are aimed towards Davokar from atop outposts and wall-\u00adtowers.</p> <p>Catapult. Ballistic devices have long been employed in Alberetor\u2019s many wars, and most frequently used, then and now, is the catapult. Compared to its bigger cousin, the trebuchet, it is relatively easy to transport but still very effective against both structures and troops. It takes someone proficient with siege weapons to load, aim and fire a catapult; it can be loaded with boulders or with breaching pots, the former crushing buildings and the latter more effective against weaker but flammable targets, including hostile troop formations on the field of battle.</p> <p>Missile Battery. The missile battery is a siege weapon unsuitable for use by anyone but trained Sappers. It consists of a wooden frame into which dozens of missiles can be loaded. When ignited, the burning, screeching missiles rain down on the enemy troops.</p> <p>Trebuchet. The queen of siege weapons is the mighty trebuchet, a ballistic device with power enough to raze the sturdiest walls, at least after a number of shots. The trebuchet can only be handled by someone proficient with siege weapons.</p>"},{"location":"5.Equipment/Weapons/#weapon-properties","title":"WEAPON PROPERTIES","text":"<p>Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapon tables.</p>"},{"location":"5.Equipment/Weapons/#ammunition","title":"Ammunition.","text":"<p>You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you also have an appropriate type of ammunition to fire from the weapon.

Or if Theseus couldn't behead Medusa with a single, well planned strike.</p> <p>I have used some called shots systems in the past, and yes, they are broken, but they have been very fun for my players. Here's a pretty basic example that you can try:</p> <p>\u2022 The PC describes their attack, i.e., what they intend to strike, and the intended effect, \"I'm going to use my greataxe to chop the constrictor snake's head off!\"</p> <p>\u2022 They must then prepare for the strike for a minimum of three rounds. During this time, they can use the move, hide, dodge, or disengage actions, but no other actions as they plan their strike.</p> <p>\u2022 On the 4th round or later, they can roll to hit with disadvantage (only with the planned weapon or attack spell). The disadvantage cannot be changed to \"normal\" under any circumstances, magical or otherwise. Period.</p> <p>\u2022 The attack does maximum triple-dice damage (a greataxe would do 36 damage + all other modifiers).</p> <p>\u2022If the total = half the total remaining HP of the enemy, the creature is slain, in the manner planned by the PC. i.e., the minotaur's head is lopped off, or the arrow pierces the beholder's eye, entering its brain to kill it.

It is very much a matter of belief, action and feedback, but less about clear-cut good and evil. We do not think you need alignments to play in this world. You can of course use them, if you want to; it\u2019s not incompatible, just not necessary for the world to make sense.</p>"},{"location":"7.%20House%20Rules/Corruption_and_Shadow/#corruption","title":"CORRUPTION","text":"<p>Power corrupts, and in Ruins of Symbaroum this is quite literally true. A fundamental principle is that when nature is cultivated or violated it grows dark and vengeful \u2013 and strikes back! The darkness that comes alive in this way feeds off and can continue to infect its surroundings. Since Mystics bend and warp nature according to their will, they are constantly threatened by Corruption. This principle is mirrored in the concept of Shadows and in creatures like abominations and the undead.</p> <p>Corruption starts at 0 and increases from there. Most Corruption gathered is temporary, your character struggles against a dark foe, or uses non-permanent magic and their Shadow temporarily grows darker. However, sometimes you will gain permanent Corruption, usually by taking up a powerful magical item or by exceeding your Corruption Threshold.</p> <p>For non-Mystic characters, your Corruption Threshold is equal to the total of twice your proficiency bonus plus your Charisma modifier, as the influence of a darkening Shadow makes most people gloomy and morose. So the formula is:</p> <p>Corruption Threshold\u00a0= ([your proficiency bonus \u00d7 2] + your Charisma modifier), minimum 2.</p> <p>During the course of the game, you will gain temporary Corruption. You might also start with a certain amount of permanent Corruption, due to your equipment or mishaps in the past. Your starting Corruption value can never be lower than your permanent Corruption score.</p> <p>If your total Corruption (temporary plus permanent) exceeds your Corruption Threshold, you must make a Corruption check, to see if you can bear so much darkness. Roll a d20. If the result is equal to or less than the amount by which your current Corruption exceeds your Threshold, you will gain a mark of Corruption. Roll 1d20 on the Marks of Corruption table to the right. The mark fades 24 hours after your total Corruption drops below your Corruption Threshold.</p> <p>Example:\u00a0Mira\u2019s ogre mystic Grumpa has been casting several spells in a desperate bid to escape some unwise hunters. Grumpa\u2019s Corruption Threshold is 7 and Mira\u2019s last casting brings her current Corruption to 10. 10 (current Corruption) minus 7 (Corruption threshold) equals 3. She rolls a d20 and if the result is 3 or lower, Grumpa will gain a mark of Corruption.</p> <p>You only make a roll when you gain new Corruption and that new Corruption exceeds your Threshold.

Sometimes, poor rolls lead to you doing less damage on a critical hit than a normal hit. For instance, you might roll two 1\u2019s on your 2d8, which with your +3 Strength modifier is only 5 damage. This feels lackluster. With this rule, instead of rolling the damage dice twice, you instead maximize the damage once and then roll the second die.

It may well assist them to accomplish their goals but they must still accomplish those goals by their own strength and wits, not simply by spending Fate Points!</li> </ul> <p>For example, a character captured by the law and imprisoned might spend a Fate Point to have a chance at escape, such as a comrade or slave-girl smuggling him a dagger or a guard becoming drunk on duty, or the discovery of a loose chunk of granite with which to smash open his ankle-chain. He may not, however, have his escape handed to him on a plate, such as by a sorcerer magically putting all the guards to sleep and bursting his door open.</p> <p>Another option for this use of a Fate Point is to alter a character in some minor way by revealing a new facet of his past. This might include knowing a language that he did not know before, which proves useful in his current situation or having a contact in the area from his previous dealings in the region.</p> <p>One good use of Destiny is when the players are at a dead end in an adventure. Perhaps they have missed some crucial clue or failed to puzzle out where to go next. A single Fate Point in this case is usually enough for the Games Master to offer some kind of in-game hint. Preferably, this will not be so blatant as to have a friendly Non-Player Character give the Player Characters the answer outright but, instead, might be something more along the lines of the background information often given out in Conan stories. For example, a lotus-dream could reveal a vision of the past history of creatures and places crucial to the plot; or an ancient scroll could be uncovered that, with a Decipher Script check and a bit of logic, could provide a hint as to where to look next.</p> <p>The Games Master will be more likely to accept proposed uses of Destiny which could plausibly relate to a character\u2019s own future destiny, as reflected by his goals. For example, in the story Black Colossus, Conan is offered the position of commander of a nation\u2019s armies and given a fine suit of plate armour as an indication of his position. Everyone around observes a regal quality about him which they had not seen before. This is a deliberate foreshadowing of his destiny to one day be King of Aquilonia. Had Conan\u2019s player always made it clear that his ambition was to one day be king, the Games Master might allow him to be made commander for just one Fate Point, since it would allow that very foreshadowing.</p> <p>Adapted from Conan: The Roleplaying Game\u00a02nd Edition by Mongoose Publishing.</p>"},{"location":"7.%20House%20Rules/Fate%20Points/#gaining-more-fate-points","title":"Gaining More Fate Points","text":"<p>When a player spends a Fate Point, it is gone forever.

(A failure on this check has no effect.)</p> <p>If the Persuasion check beats the DC, the subject accepts the proposal, with no changes or with minor (mostly idiosyncratic) changes. If the check fails by 5 or less, the subject does not accept the deal but may, at the DM\u2019s option, present a counter-offer that would push the deal up one place on the risk-vs.-reward list. For example, a counter-offer might make an Even deal Favorable for the subject. The character who made the Persuasion check can simply accept the counter-offer, if they choose; no further check will be required. If the check fails by 10 or more, the Persuasion is over; the subject will entertain no further deals, and may become hostile or take other steps to end the conversation.</p> <p>Just because a deal has been accepted, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the other character is happy about it. If you use your relationship to take advantage of someone, it may affect their future relationship with you (at the DM\u2019s discretion).</p> <p>MODIFIERS:</p> <p>Quick Persuasion: You can make a Persuasion check as a standard action at Disadvantage to the check.</p> <p>TRY AGAIN: No, unless you can significantly change the circumstances of the check. For example, if you fail to convince a caravan owner that there is an orc ambush on the road ahead, presenting the caravan owner with the body of a dead orc might justify a new check. When making a persuasion check you can attempt to alter the parameters of the deal to make it more appealing to the target \u2014 if you do so, you use the same check result but compare it to the DC set by the new deal.</p> <p>PERSUASION CHECKS</p> <p>TASK    DC  ACTION</p> <p>Convince    12* 1 minute</p> <p>Overcome Intransigence  12 + target's HD + target's Wisdom modifier*    1 minute</p> <p>Persuasion  12**    1 minute</p> <ul> <li>Modified by relationship.     </li> </ul> <p>** Modified by relationship and risk vs. reward.</p> <p>RELATIONSHIP</p> <p>DC  RELATIONSHIP (Example)</p> <p>-12 Intimate (someone with whom you have an implicit trust; a lover or spouse)</p> <p>-9  Friend (someone with whom you have a regularly positive personal relationship; a long-time buddy or sibling)</p> <p>-6  Ally (someone on the same team, but with whom you have no personal relationship; a cleric of the same religion or a knight serving the same king)</p> <p>-3  Acquaintance -- Positive (someone you've met several times with no particularly negative experiences; the blacksmith that buys your looted equipment regularly)</p> <p>0   Just Met (no relationship whatsoever)</p> <p>+3  Acquaintance -- Negative (someone you've met several times with no particularly positive experience; the town guard that has arrested you for drunkenness once or twice)</p> <p>+6  Enemy (someone on an opposed team with whom you have no personal relationship; a cleric of an opposed religion or the orc bandit robbing you)</p> <p>+9  Personal Foe (someone with whom you have a regularly antagonistic personal relationship; an evil overlord you're trying to thwart or a bounty hunter sworn to track you down)</p> <p>+12 Nemesis (someone who has sworn to do you, personally, harm; the brother of a man you murdered in cold blood)</p> <p>RISK VS. REWARD</p> <p>DC  RISK VS. REWARD JUDGMENT (Example)</p> <p>-12 Fantastic (The reward for accepting the deal is very worthwhile; the risk is either acceptable or extremely unlikely. The best-case scenario is a virtual guarantee. Example: An offer to pay a lot of gold for information that isn't important to the character.)</p> <p>-8  Good (The reward is good and the risk is minimal. The subject is very likely to proift from the deal. Example: An offer to pay someone twice their normal daily wage to spend their evening in a seedy tavern with a reputation for vicious brawls and later report on everyone they saw there.)</p> <p>-4  Favorable (The reward is appealing, but there's risk involved. If all goes according to plan, though, the deal will end up benefiting the subject. Example: A request for a mercenary to aid the party in battle against a weak goblin tribe in return for a cut of the money and first pick of the magic items.)</p> <p>0   Even (The reward and risk more of less even out; or the deal involves neither reward nor risk. Example: A request for directions to a place that isn't a secret.)</p> <p>+4  Unfavorable (The reward is not enough compared to the risk involved. Even if all goes according to plan, chances are it will end badly for the subject. Example: A request to free a prisoner the target is guarding for a small amount of money.)</p> <p>+8  Bad (The reward is poor and the risk is high. The subject is very likely to get the raw end of the deal. Example: A request for a mercenary to aid the party in battle against an ancient red dragon for a small cut of any non-magical treasure.)</p> <p>+12 Horrible (There is no conceivable way that the proposed plan could end up with the subject ahead or the worst-case scenario is guaranteed to occur. Example: An offer to trade a rusty kitchen knife for a shiny new longsword.)</p> <p>SUPPLEMENTAL RULES</p> <p>Charm Spells: A charmed creature is treated as having a Friendly relationship to the caster (-10 to Persuasion DC ), which replaces any previous relationship modifier (unless the target already had an Intimate relationship with the character). Thus, by charming an enemy, the DC drops from +5 to -10, a decrease of 15. The caster can now talk the creature into anything this improved relationship allows. Because the effect is based on the spell, the caster can make a Knowledge Arcana check in place of a Persuasion check when dealing with charmed creatures.</p> <p>Cons: In order to pull a con a character simply makes a Deception check to convince the target that a deal is better than it actually is. The Deception check is opposed by a Insight check, just like any other Deception check, but this Insight check result replaces the normal Insight check made as part of an honest persuasion check. If the Deception check is successful, the DC of the Persuasion check is set using whatever the target believes the deal to be. If the Deception check fails, the DC of the Persuasion check is set using the actual quality of the deal and the check itself suffers an additional -20 penalty (it is practically impossible to work a deal with someone who has caught you trying to con them).</p> <p>Living with the Rule</p> <p>Extended Example:</p> <p>A 5th level party is trying to get into an extravagant ball being thrown by a local baron (who is secretly an evil cultist). The party bard, with a Persuasion of +10, tries to talk his way in. Three guards at the door are only letting in those who are on The List. Their captain is a 5th level fighter, and they are accompanied by a 1st level aristocrat with a Wisdom of 13, giving a base DC of 18 (the remaining guards are lower level and have Wisdoms of 10, so they don't add to the DC.) The guards have never met the adventurers before, so the Relationship modifier is +0. The final DC, however, depends on how the bard chooses to try to talk their way past the guards:</p> <pre><code>\u2022 If the party approaches the guards and simply asks to be let in, they are offering a risk of \"failing in your duty and probably getting fired or reprimanded\" against a reward of \"nothing\". The guards might not get caught, but don't really get anything out of the deal either; it's an Unfavorable deal and gets a +4 increase to the DC, for a total of 22. The bard needs to roll a 12 or higher; not impossible, but risky.\n\n\u2022 If the party slips a pouch with 20 platinum pieces into the hand of the guard captain first, though, the deal becomes more favorable. Since even split four ways, the platinum is a decent amount of money compared to how much they get paid. Sure, they might get fired, but the platinum could keep them well-fed until they found another job anyway. The deal is now Favorable, and gets a -4 decrease to the DC, for a total of 14. The bard needs to roll a 4 or better-pretty easy.\n\n\u2022 If the party dresses up as aristocrats and successfully Deceptions the guards into believing they are nobles, the deal alters as well. The guard may get fired for letting in someone who is not on The List, but then, this noble before him may get him fired for keeping them out of the season's social event. Either way, the guard might lose his job, so the deal is Even, and the DC stays at 18. Our bard needs to now roll an 8 or better to succeed.\n\n\u2022 If, unbeknownst to the bard, the guard captain is fully aware of the evil baron's cult activities, things change again. First, the baron may have threatened the captain with a painful death if he fails his duty; thus, whatever method the bard uses to approach the guard will be one step less favorable, since the worst-case scenario is a brutal death rather than just job termination. The risk is much higher than the captain lets on, so if they offer him nothing in return the deal is Horrible for him, increasing the DC by +10 for a total of 28; the bard needs to roll an 18 or better-very unlikely. Further, if the captain is in on the baron's evil dealings and recognizes the adventurers as agents of Good, he might be considered an Enemy and qualify for an additional +6 increase to the DC based on relationship, for a total of 34! This is a recipe for disaster if the bard attempts it, but he doesn't know that.\n\n\u2022 But then again, if they discover that guard is Lawful Good, the bard can suggest that they are there to take expose the baron's dirty deeds. The bard is still offering no money, but now the \"payment\" is the action the adventurers will take that supports and exemplifies the guard's alignment. The deal is Favorable for him once again, since even if he is fired, he will have the satisfaction of knowing he helped thwart an evil plan. If the bard also slips the captain 20 platinum, it might push the deal up to Fantastic, for a grand total DC of 10. The bard then needs a 0: he will automatically succeed, though of course he doesn't know that either.\n\n\u2022 Finally, let's say the bard offers a bribe, but it is only 50 gold pieces. That's not enough to split 4 ways and live off if they get fired, but it is decent-an Even deal, DC 18, and the bard needs an 8 on the die. But whoops! He rolls a 5! That's within 5 of the DC, though, so the captain looks at the gold and replies that this is only enough for one of them, and that he needs another 50 gp for his three friends. He's giving the bard the parameters of what would make the deal Favorable to him-200 gp, as in the first example. The bard can either pony up the extra 150 and end the conversation now, or he can try a completely different tack and roll again.\n</code></pre> <p>Options and Ideas:</p> <pre><code>\u2022 At first read, it may seem like a pain to remember the two modifiers. There are two things that make it easier, though. First, in most games, 90% of all Persuasion checks will be against total strangers, which is a +0 Relationship modifier. If there's no established relationship, there's no Relationship modifier. Second, notice that both modifiers have the same set-up: +12 to -12. That's intentional; even if you can't remember what modifier is appropriate, you can easily \"wing it\" by just remembering the upper and lower limit allowable, and judging accordingly.\n\n\u2022 The new Persuasion skill offers a built-in definition for the sometimes-difficult-to-adjudicate [[charm person]] spell: a charmed creature is treated as having a Friendly relationship to the caster (-9 to Persuasion DC), which replaces any previous relationship modifier. Thus, by charming an enemy, the DC drops from +6 to -9, a decrease of 15. The caster can now talk the creature into anything this improved relationship allows, without every NPC being wrapped around the caster's finger because of a 1st level spell. Note, however, that this will make the spell far more useful to a bard, who has Persuasion as a class skill and has a high Charisma, than to a wizard. You might like that-maybe the bard should be better at charming people-but if not, I suggest allowing the caster of charm person to use his or her caster level in place of their Persuasion skill check for that creature only. Thus, the DC is still affected by the Risk/Reward modifier and the (newly improved) Relationship modifier, but the check is either a Persuasion check or a straight caster level check.\n\n\u2022 Sometimes, you may not have a good appreciation of what might be a good deal to offer. You can use Intelligence skill checks to determine what a \"fair trade\" might be. Divination spells might play a part as well; a well-timed augury or even a detect thoughts spell can give you a decent idea of what a particular NPC might find valuable.\n\n\u2022 Resist the urge to throw in lots of circumstance modifiers. The point of this system is to incorporate the NPC's overall evaluation of the situation into one number, so avoid giving modifiers like \"+2 because they are wary.\" That should already be covered when they ponder the Risk vs. Reward factor and when their Wisdom modifier is applied to the DC. You might consider a modifier in a situation where the physical situation makes Persuasion more difficult, such as shouting across a bridge, or having your words relayed through a third party, but try not to \"double-dip\" for situations for which the system already accounts\n</code></pre> <p>Originally written for D&amp;D3.5e by The Alexandrian.

If the character meets or exceeds the DC, the surgery is a success. If they fail to meet the DC, they have not yet succeeded and may be able to reattempt.</p> <p>Max Vigor Point Damage. The character undergoing surgery takes damage to their maximum Vigor points equal to their class's Recovery die (for example, a Barbarian takes 1d12 of damage to their maximum Vigor points). If the DC is failed by 10 or more, the character undergoing surgery takes two Recovery dice worth of damage to their max Vigor points instead. This damage represents trauma to the body through surgery and loss of blood. It occurs whether or not the surgery was a success.</p> <p>Decision to Continue. If the DC was not met, it increases (cumulatively) by 1. The surgeon may choose to either proceed with surgery and make another surgeons' tools ability check or abandon the surgery.</p> <p>Dying Patients. If the character's maximum hit points are ever reduced to 0, they are dying. If the surgeon immediately abandons the surgery at this point they are stabilized and regain 1 to their max Vigor points.

After defeating a grick and nearly losing Dorian, Vix realized there was more to Rose than previously thought and the party returned to her room to vetch the spells contained within her diary.

A short rest was needed to gather your nerves within this dreadful place. With minutes left until midnight you explored deeper into the crypts only to be attacked by the boneless flayed skin of Gustav Durst. And at its defeat, the midnight chime came.

Doru and the members of his mob never returned.</p> <p>\u2022 Shortly thereafter, a dusk elf named Rahadin visited the village to deliver a warning: the Devil had awoken from his coffin, and the villagers of Barovia had ninety days to make peace with their gods. Some Barovians fled for Vallaki, but a majority chose to remain in Barovia and defend their homes.</p> <p>\u2022 Two weeks ago, Strahd made good on his threat.

It was after this, at the crossroads that Strahd appeared, like an apparition, coming from our very same destination, Tser Pool. He thinks himself a gentlemen as he grasps the lives of men in his palms and squeezes. The way he looks at me makes my skin crawl. I was surprised the visitors were able to hold themselves back from his insults. Especially Radmill. Strahd loaths all humans but it would seem he loaths the lives of dwarfs even more. Bogokom and Radmil did well to reason with Strahd though. He could have taken me right then and there. Is this all just some sick game to him? Poor Escher. Another soul lost to the darkness and forced to drive carriage for the devil. I was more than relieved when he finally departed but his game was not over. I don\u2019t know what Radmill saw in that hanging man but his despair was intense. Perhaps the evil in this land is fraying these visitors more than I anticipated. I\u2019ll keep an eye on them.

The druids of the First Folk paid homage to the Ladies at their holy sites\u2014three fanes that dwelled within the valley, known as the Mountain Fane, the Forest Fane, and the Swamp Fane. Each Fane held a gemstone imbued with the power of the Weaver, which was said to give life and vitality to the wilderness around it. \"This wand,\" Kavan notes somberly, \"was once wielded by those who connected our people to the Rozana.\"</p> <p>Nearly one thousand years ago, Kavan came to power as chieftain of his tribe. Arrogant and proud, he defied his people\u2019s strictures and ventured forth into the Whispering Wall, a wall of thick fog said to hold the corpse of the Devourer\u2014an ancient monster that the Ladies killed long before.</p> <p>While within the Wall, Kavan learned terrible secrets\u2014including the means by which he could steal the Huntress\u2019s sacred spear from the Forest Fane and claim its power for his own. Upon doing so, he waged war on the other tribes, reuniting them beneath his own banner. The servants of the Seeker, a clan of wereravens, hid away the life-giving gems that blessed the Fanes to conceal them from his ambitions, and vanished into the wilderness. (Upon saying this, Kavan gives Muriel a long, meaningful look, though he cannot confirm whether she is spiritually descended from one of the original wereravens that served the Seeker.)</p> <p>The druids of the First Folk condemned Kavan for his hubris, and retreated to the village of Soldav in the Balinok Mountains, their people\u2019s most sacred site and the center of their faith. They named Kavan \u201cenemy,\" and banished him from Soldav for his crimes. When he died, instead of burying him in a place of honor upon Yester Hill with the great chieftains of the past, the druids buried him here, in a lonely cairn far from the graves of his forefathers. Kavan has been haunted by his isolation from his people as a result ever since his death.</p> <p>In Kavan\u2019s ailing years, a tyrant named King Dostron the Hellborn invaded the valley with his army, scattering the First Folk and destroying their homes. He dammed up the Luna River to make farmland, and shattered the First Folks\u2019 faith in the Ladies Three. When Dostron died, his armies withdrew and abandoned his fortress, but the First Folk remained apart and weak.</p> <p>When Strahd invaded the valley hundreds of years later, many members of the druidic caste\u2014still angered by Kavan\u2019s betrayal and Dostron\u2019s oppression\u2014sought out his protection. A great schism split the First Folk, with those who opposed Strahd retreating to Soldav and those who favored Strahd remaining within the Svalich Wood. Today, Barovians know them as the Mountain Folk and the Forest Folk. The land of Barovia, which the First Folk once called \u201cGirvisa\"\u2014meaning \u201cfertile land\"\u2014has been corrupted by Strahd\u2019s will and magic.

The order was founded by Lord Argynvost\u2014a man of great wealth, kindness, and valor. Only Godfrey and the remainder of Argynvost\u2019s most trusted knights knew Argynvost\u2019s deepest secret: that he was, in truth, a silver dragon in disguise. </p> <p>Not ten years after the Order first settled at Argynvostholt, Strahd von Zarovich brought war to the lands surrounding the valley. The Order ranged far afield to defend against Zarovich\u2019s invading armies and shelter those made refugees by the violence, but ultimately found itself driven back to the valley and, ultimately, the mansion of Argynvostholt.</p> <p>A great battle took place on the floodplain east of the mansion, and many of the knights of the Order were slaughtered. As Godfrey and his commander, Vladimir Horngaard, led a final sortie against the enemy general\u2019s camp, both were killed as well\u2014Commander Horngaard by Zarovich himself, and Godfrey by Zarovich\u2019s second-in-command: a cruel-eyed dusk elf bearing twin scimitars. (If asked, Godfrey can confirm that the elf was Rahadin, the current chamberlain of Castle Ravenloft.)</p> <p>Several years thereafter, Godfrey felt Commander Horngaard\u2019s rage pull his soul from beyond the grave, and found himself and the other knights of the Order returned to life as undead revenants. He learned that Zarovich had desecrated Argynvost\u2019s remains, burning the dragon's bones and taking his skull as a trophy to the new Castle Ravenloft\u2014an act so foul it had stirred Horngaard to vengeful hatred even in death.</p> <p>The revenant knights renewed the fight against Strahd, waging war for months\u2014until the Mists descended upon Barovia. The knights marched on Castle Ravenloft, where the Vistani crone Madam Eva met them at the castle gates. She told them Strahd had died and been reborn, and that he and all Barovia were now captives of the Mists.</p> <p>Commander Horngaard and the knights returned to Argynvostholt. There, Commander Horngaard, his heart still clutched by hate, forbade the members of the Order from fighting Zarovich, who Commander Horngaard believed deserved to suffer in his prison for all eternity. Later, Commander Horngaard expanded his interdiction to Strahd\u2019s servants and creatures as well, believing that Strahd\u2019s dark dominion would only drive him to deeper levels of pain and misery\u2014for what was a conqueror without anything left to conquer?</p> <p>The knights of the Order reluctantly obeyed Horngaard\u2019s order, even as they watched the people of Barovia sink deeper into despair. As Strahd slumbered in his tomb, many among them came to believe that the Barovians\u2019 nightmare may one day lift\u2014until a knight came bearing news of a failed rebellion from the village of Barovia to the southeast, and Strahd\u2019s threat to wipe the village and its people from the valley.</p> <p>A great quarrel erupted, as the knights demanded the right to defend the village from Strahd\u2019s vengeance. Commander Horngaard, angered by their defiance, banished the other knights from the mansion. Only Godfrey, restrained by his bindings, did Horngaard allow to remain.</p> <p>Argynvost may have fallen in the war against Strahd, but his spirit still lingers at Argynvostholt. In the decades after the Mists first descended, the dragon\u2019s spirit appeared to Commander Horngaard in flickering visions, urging him away from his path of hatred and vengeance. However, Horngaard never turned from his path, and Argynvost\u2019s spirit gradually fell quiet, sinking into a silent, dormant slumber.</p> <p>Shortly after Strahd awoke from his hibernation, Argynvost\u2019s spirit began to stir again, though Godfrey doesn\u2019t know why. The dragon\u2019s spirit is too old and weak to manifest directly, but several of the other ghosts that haunt the mansion\u2019s halls claim to have heard him whispering in his ethereal slumber, murmuring of a new generation of heroes, and a new and final front in the fight against darkness. When the knights of the order were banished from Argynvostholt, Godfrey sent them to seek out those who Argynvost might be searching for, and direct them toward the manor.</p>"},{"location":"RoS-CoS-RRL/Recap/Lore/#brother-marek-on-st-markovia","title":"Brother Marek on St. Markovia","text":"<ul> <li>In life, he was the chaplain of the Order of the Silver Dragon.

Strahd is the one NPC in the entire campaign that (until they obtain the Sunsword) your players cannot hurt in any meaningful way. Their strongest attacks do little more than tickle him. Their cruelest insults merely amuse him. Enter Strahd-related scenes without fear of player action.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Embrace Unpredictability. In each scene before [[Arc R - The Tyrant's Trials]], Strahd has no particular goal, and won't be disappointed if events unfold differently than he expected. Release any obligation you feel to make the scene conclude in a particular way.</p> </li> <li> <p>Explore Darkness. Strahd provides a risk-free opportunity to explore and relish darker emotions, such as (justified) arrogance, (quiet) cruelty, and (subtle) contempt. Savor those emotions and the impact they have on your players.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Spoilers/NPC%27s/Strahd%20von%20Zarovich/#challenging-strahd","title":"+ Challenging Strahd","text":"<p>If, at any point during the encounter, a player challenges Strahd or insists that he must be defeated, Strahd smiles, admits he's \"never been one to decline a challenge,\" and invites the player to defeat him\u2014right here, right now\u2014if they can. He promises to make no effort to stop them for the first thirty seconds of their assault.</p> <p>If the player declines, Strahd dismisses them as a coward, noting with disappointment, \"A pity. I had hoped for better.\" If the player accepts, Strahd allows them to attack him for five full rounds. During this time, each attack the player makes against Strahd automatically hits, and Strahd automatically fails all Strength and Dexterity saving throws.</p> <p>When the five rounds have elapsed, Strahd says, \"Impressive determination\u2014if ultimately futile.\" He adds, \"Now, let us see how you fare when the true game begins.\" </p> <p>Assuming his Mage form, Strahd casts telekinetic grasp each round to suspend the player in the air above him, and casts blindness/deafness as a reaction whenever the player makes a melee attack against him. The first time the player fails their saving throw against telekinetic grasp, he says, \"Escape if you can.\" He then adds, in a lower tone: \"But should you find yourself lacking, a simple plea for mercy will release you from your plight.\"</p> <p>The first time the player succeeds their saving throw against telekinetic grasp, Strahd applauds their tenacity, then asks whether they shall choose to continue to fight.

Strahd views the cult of Death House with respectful disdain; he finds their methods and obsessions distasteful, but appreciates their efforts to bring worthy consorts and adversaries from the lands beyond the Mists.</p> <p>Village of Barovia. Strahd believes, without romance or obsession, that Ireena Kolyana\u2019s body is the host for Tatyana\u2019s soul, and that Tatyana\u2019s soul belongs to him. Through his spies, he is aware of Ismark Kolyanovich\u2019s position and relationship to Ireena, but finds him to be a lackluster leader and a half-rate swordsman. He views [[Donavich]] and Doru with scorn, disdaining the convictions, pride, and faith that Doru had in life.</p> <p>Tser Pool Encampment. Strahd finds [[Madam Eva]] a fascinating enigma, but has come to an unspoken understanding with her: she shall read his fortune whenever he requests it, and, in exchange, he will not delve too deeply into her history or affairs.</p> <p>Old Bonegrinder. Strahd is aware of the night hag coven\u2019s presence, but has little interest in their affairs.</p> <p>Town of Vallaki. Strahd has no interest in Baron Vargas Vallakovich, but, through his spies, believes him to be a bumbling fool. He finds Lady Fiona Wachter to be a useful agent and favors her for her family\u2019s history of loyalty, but cares little for her obsession with Vallakian politics. He is aware of the existence of the Keepers of the Feather (though not that the Blue Water Inn serves as their meeting-place), but does not view them as a significant threat. </p> <p>Vistani Encampment. Strahd holds Arrigal as one of his favored spies. However, he pays little mind to the dusk elves\u2014Kasimir especially\u2014and has little interest in their affairs.</p> <p>Argynvostholt. Strahd views the revenants of the Order of the Silver Dragon with disinterested contempt, but has long since determined that the knights pose no threat to him, and has largely ignored them as a result. He has heard the rumors that Argynvost\u2019s spirit haunts the manor, but pays them no mind; he would refuse to believe that the beacon of Argynvostholt could be relit even if told to his face.</p> <p>Wizard of Wines. Strahd is aware that the winery is a stronghold for the Keepers of the Feather, but does not view them as a significant threat. He has delegated their \u201cdiscipline\u201d to Ludmilla, ensuring that their insubordination and resistance will be properly punished.</p> <p>Yester Hill. Strahd views the Forest Folk with disdain and some amusement. He finds their maddened worship to be more grating than gratifying, and views the modern generation as a poor shadow of their more distinguished forebears. He does find them to be useful tools, however, and knows that their \u201cfaith\u201d is a necessary evil to ensure their continued loyalty.</p> <p>Village of Krezk. Strahd has little interest in Baron Dmitri Krezkov or the people of Krezk. He is, amused by the Abbot\u2019s descent into madness and corruption. He intends to temporarily \u201cplay along\u201d with the Abbot\u2019s efforts to construct a flesh golem bride for him, but has no serious intention of accepting Vasilka when complete.</p> <p>Werewolf Den. Strahd finds Kiril Stoyanovich to be a useful and loyal servant, if somewhat brutish and unsophisticated. He intends to keep Emil Toranescu, the pack\u2019s former alpha, as a prisoner in his dungeons until Emil is sufficiently mad with starvation to be \u201ctamed.\u201d</p> <p>Tsolenka Pass. Strahd is peripherally aware that the Mountain Folk roam the Balinok Mountains, but\u2014due to Elder Ormir\u2019s protection\u2014is unaware of the existence of their settlement Yaedrag. He considers the Mountain Folk to be a lost and broken people and has no use for or interest in them.</p> <p>Amber Temple. Strahd respects Neferon\u2019s dedication to protecting the temple and finds him to be a worthy guardian of the treasures contained within. He has historically had a collegial respect for Exethanter, but, after awakening from his own hibernation, was disappointed by Exethanter\u2019s loss of memory\u2014something Strahd has little interest in restoring.</p> <p>Castle Ravenloft. Strahd is amused by the efforts of his brides\u2014Ludmilla Vilisevic, Anastrasya Karelova, and Volenta Popfsky\u2014to placate and impress him. He is momentarily entertained by his newest consort, Escher, but has been distracted lately by other, grander designs. He views Rahadin as his most loyal, trusted, and favored servant, but spares little mind to the other staff and occupants of the castle, including Cyrus Belview, Lief Lipsiege, the coven of witches, and his own vampire spawn. By contrast, Beucephalus is his favored \u201cpet\u201d and most valued tool.</p>"},{"location":"Spoilers/NPC%27s/Strahd%20von%20Zarovich/#strahds-goals","title":"Strahd\u2019s Goals","text":"<p>Strahd\u2019s primary goal is simple: to free himself and Barovia from the Mists.</p> <p>As a conqueror, Strahd craves new lands and the freedom\u2014and power\u2014to claim them.

He bade Rahadin to find staff and attendants for Castle Ravenloft, and to ensure that each of the keep\u2019s occupants served their master\u2019s will. And he summoned his brides and spawn to Castle Ravenloft, commanding them to spread his shadow across the valley once more.</p> <p>Since then, Strahd has broken the village of Barovia and brought the werewolf pack to heel.

This ritual has three necessary components: a power source, a control mechanism, and a catalyst.</p> <p>The Power Source. Strahd\u2019s plan requires a substantial amount of power\u2014far more than he can supply himself. So long as he remains bonded to the Fanes of Barovia, however, he can channel their power directly into the Heart of Sorrow for use in the ritual. </p> <p>Using the Fanes in the ritual will also allow Strahd to bring the valley itself\u2014and all of its inhabitants\u2014along with him to the Material Plane. Given that Barovia was his final conquest and the centerpiece of his power, Strahd will not relinquish it so easily.</p> <p>The Control Mechanism. The raw power of the leylines beneath the Fanes is wild and near-impossible to control. Even as their master, only a token of the Ladies\u2019 divinity can allow Strahd to direct them. He has recently learned that a child with the blood of the Seeker resides somewhere within the valley\u2014the Vistana Arabelle, though Strahd does not yet know her name\u2014and has directed his spies to locate and capture her. </p> <p>Should this plot fail, Strahd must instead journey to the Whispering Wall at Yester Hill and make a sacrifice of great personal value\u2014his animated armor, the symbol of his early conquests and might\u2014exchanging a piece of his past for a promise of his future.</p> <p>The Catalyst. Power and control are all well and good. In order to break through a wall, however, all good conquerors need a point of attack. To this end, Strahd plans to forge a battering ram capable of piercing through the Mists\u2014a siege weapon forged from the souls of the Barovians themselves.</p> <p>The Mists, as creations of the Dark Powers, are born of apathy, fear, and despair. To escape the Mists without drawing their ire, therefore, Strahd intends to surround the Heart of Sorrow with a shell of wailing, hopeless souls. He believes that, by brutally reasserting his dominion over Barovia, his subjects will lose themselves to fear and despair, darkening their souls to meet his needs.</p> <p>By consuming the Barovians\u2019 souls, Strahd can also use the energies of his escape to repurpose their soulless husks as undead soldiers, forging a new army for his conquests to come. The sole exceptions include Ireena Kolyana and Dr. Rudolph van Richten, who Strahd will allow to keep their souls for his own purposes.</p> <p>Plans Within Plans. If the players reconsecrate the Fanes, Strahd quickly devises a backup plan. By becoming the champions of the Fanes, the players will unknowingly have made themselves into conduits for their power, allowing Strahd to access the Fanes\u2019 energies if he can lure the players to Castle Ravenloft. </p> <p>He can do this by using the power stored in the Heart of Sorrow to plunge Barovia into eternal night, raising the deceased from their graves and sending a plague of undead against Barovia\u2019s settlements\u2014a siege that will end only if Strahd himself is defeated.

The Gentleman, the Tyrant, and the Monster reflect three distinct popular community interpretations of Strahd's character. Many DMs will attempt to combine two or more of these archetypes into their campaign at a time, but doing so can risk making Strahd's character feel inconsistent and unpredictable. </p> <p>As such, this section provides a structured, methodical approach to developing Strahd's character through his relationship with the players. Importantly, each transition is tied to a particular point in the adventure's timeline, ensuring that Strahd does not, for example, spoil his relationship with the players before inviting them to dinner, or treat them as enemies before they have the capacity to defend themselves.</p> <p>Strahd's Relationships. This section preserves Strahd's canonical relationship with Ireena in order to keep his (cold, calculating, and sociopathic) characterization consistent.</p> <p>Strahd's Goals. This section is structured to ensure a high-tension, action-packed sequence of challenges from the beginning to the end of the campaign. Specifically, it explains:</p> <ul> <li>why Strahd does not simply seize Ireena from the players (he fears the Dark Powers\u2019 intervention if he does not escape Barovia first); </li> <li>why Strahd\u2019s forces are attacking St. Andral\u2019s Church and the Wizard of Wines winery (he seeks to break the Barovians\u2019 spirit to fuel his escape ritual); </li> <li>why Strahd does not assist his forces in defeating the players at St. Andral\u2019s Church or the Wizard of Wines winery (he seeks to separate the weak from the strong);</li> <li>why Strahd \u201ctests\u201d the players instead of killing them (he wants to find generals for his future armies);</li> <li>why the players must reconsecrate the Fanes (they must stop Strahd from using them in his ritual and remove Strahd's immortality);</li> <li>why Strahd does not simply kill the players when they reconsecrate the Fanes (he seeks to use them as alternate conduits to the Fanes); </li> <li>why the players cannot bring an army of allies to Castle Ravenloft (they are preoccupied defending their homes from Strahd\u2019s undead apocalypse); and </li> <li>why the players must confront Strahd at Castle Ravenloft (they must do so to end his undead apocalypse).</li> </ul> <p>Strahd's Allies. For reasons of both balance and narrative, it is important that Strahd faces the final fight alone.</p> <p>Strahd's Tactics. Strahd's original statblock is exceptionally fragile, allowing players to destroy him without the Sunsword as early as level 6. His phasing lair action, however, turns the original final battle into a torturous slog, ensuring that the players cannot win unless the Dungeon Master allows it or makes a mistake.</p> <p>Many substitute statblocks have been proposed, increasing Strahd's Challenge Rating beyond his original difficulty. However, these strengthened statblocks fail for two simple reasons: </p> <ul> <li>Any Strahd statblock that is powerful enough to survive the players' attacks for more than three rounds is also powerful enough to knock players unconscious with a single attack, thereby starting a \"death spiral\" that kills the entire party.</li> <li>Any Strahd statblock that is unable to knock players unconscious with a single attack is fragile and must rely on hit-and-run guerilla tactics instead, disappointing and frustrating players who had rightfully expected an epic confrontation.</li> </ul> <p>This issue can be solved by dramatically increasing Strahd's hit points and/or Armor Class (i.e., \"Defensive Challenge Rating\") while dramatically decreasing his attack bonus and/or damage output (i.e., \"Offensive Challenge Rating\"). These changes dramatically increase his lifespan without risking a TPK, ensuring a long, yet winnable boss battle</p> <p>Long battles, however, leave players exhausted and bored\u2014especially for playgroups whose combats run slow. To inject energy and dynamism into the fight, we can split Strahd's statblock into three parts, or \"phases,\" with each phase bestowing Strahd with new abilities and features. Each phase has been calibrated using Challenge Ratings 2.0 to survive approximately three to four rounds against an average 10th-level party wielding the Sunsword and Holy Symbol of Ravenkind and accompanied by Ezmerelda, Ireena, and their foretold ally; the entire combat encounter should last nine to twelve rounds in total.</p> <p>To strengthen the themes of the final fight, each phase reflects a part of Strahd's history and descent into darkness: the Soldier (reflecting his history as a conqueror); the Mage (reflecting his search for immortality); and the Monster (reflecting his passage into undeath).</p> <p>Even with a multi-phase statblock, however, Strahd's battlefield remains relatively stagnant. To introduce additional tactics and dynamics into the fight, each of Strahd's phases have been given the following: two attack options (for moving enemies and imposing conditions, respectively); two bonus attack options (for punishing short- and long-range foes, respectively); and two reaction options (for escaping and aggressing, respectively). </p> <p>Strahd's legendary actions have also been replaced with the ability to take multiple reactions per round, maintaining his ability to react to changing circumstances while reducing memory issues for the DM.</p> <p>Note that the Mage statblock intentionally foregoes a traditional \"spellcasting\" feature in favor of an action-oriented selection of spells. While some DMs might be disappointed by Strahd's lack of choice, it is important to remember that each phase will survive for only a short period of time; as such, Strahd's spells have been carefully curated in order to provide players with the most challenging, tactical, and memorable experience possible.</p> <p>Vampire Forbiddance. Tension is the key to horror, and monsters are therefore scary only when bound by meaningful rules. Permitting Strahd to enter any home simply because \u201che is the Land\u201d removes the players\u2019 ability to meaningfully prevent it, thereby removing a large amount of suspenseful gameplay. </p> <p>Moreover, a monster is only as resonant as its most notable weaknesses; a werewolf that cannot be killed with silver, for example, is hardly a werewolf at all. Removing Strahd\u2019s Forbiddance destroys a key part of the horror fantasy: the ability to defy a monster using its unique rules and weaknesses. As such, this guide intentionally retains that feature.</p>"},{"location":"Spoilers/NPC%27s/Strahd%20von%20Zarovich/#strahd-von-zarovich","title":"Strahd von Zarovich","text":""},{"location":"Spoilers/NPC%27s/Strahd%20von%20Zarovich/#roleplaying-strahd_1","title":"Roleplaying Strahd","text":"<p>Strahd is cold and calculating, skilled in social manipulation and deception.

Strahd believes, without romance or obsession, that Ireena Kolyana\u2019s body is the host for Tatyana\u2019s soul, and that Tatyana\u2019s soul belongs to him. Through his spies, he is aware of Ismark Kolyanovich\u2019s position and relationship to Ireena, but finds him to be a lackluster leader and a half-rate swordsman.

Strahd views the revenants of the Order of the Silver Dragon with disinterested contempt, but has long since determined that the knights pose no threat to him, and has largely ignored them as a result. He has heard the rumors that Argynvost\u2019s spirit haunts the manor, but pays them no mind; he would refuse to believe that the beacon of Argynvostholt could be relit even if told to his face.</p> <p>Wizard of Wines.

Strahd views the Forest Folk with disdain and some amusement. He finds their maddened worship to be more grating than gratifying, and views the modern generation as a poor shadow of their more distinguished forebears. He does find them to be useful tools, however, and knows that their \u201cfaith\u201d is a necessary evil to ensure their continued loyalty.</p> <p>Village of Krezk. Strahd has little interest in Baron Dmitri Krezkov or the people of Krezk. He is, amused by the Abbot\u2019s descent into madness and corruption. He intends to temporarily \u201cplay along\u201d with the Abbot\u2019s efforts to construct a flesh golem bride for him, but has no serious intention of accepting Vasilka when complete.</p> <p>Werewolf Den.

He has recently learned that a child with the blood of the Seeker resides somewhere within the valley\u2014the Vistana Arabelle, though Strahd does not yet know her name\u2014and has directed his spies to locate and capture her. </p> <p>Should this plot fail, Strahd must instead journey to the Whispering Wall at Yester Hill and make a sacrifice of great personal value\u2014his animated armor, the symbol of his early conquests and might\u2014exchanging a piece of his past for a promise of his future.</p> <p>The Catalyst. Power and control are all well and good. In order to break through a wall, however, all good conquerors need a point of attack. To this end, Strahd plans to forge a battering ram capable of piercing through the Mists\u2014a siege weapon forged from the souls of the Barovians themselves.</p> <p>The Mists, as creations of the Dark Powers, are born of apathy, fear, and despair. To escape the Mists without drawing their ire, therefore, Strahd intends to surround the Heart of Sorrow with a shell of wailing, hopeless souls. He believes that, by brutally reasserting his dominion over Barovia, his subjects will lose themselves to fear and despair, darkening their souls to meet his needs.</p> <p>By consuming the Barovians\u2019 souls, Strahd can also use the energies of his escape to repurpose their soulless husks as undead soldiers, forging a new army for his conquests to come. The sole exceptions include Ireena Kolyana and Dr. Rudolph van Richten, who Strahd will allow to keep their souls for his own purposes.</p> <p>Plans Within Plans. If the players reconsecrate the Fanes, Strahd quickly devises a backup plan. By becoming the champions of the Fanes, the players will unknowingly have made themselves into conduits for their power, allowing Strahd to access the Fanes\u2019 energies if he can lure the players to Castle Ravenloft. </p> <p>He can do this by using the power stored in the Heart of Sorrow to plunge Barovia into eternal night, raising the deceased from their graves and sending a plague of undead against Barovia\u2019s settlements\u2014a siege that will end only if Strahd himself is defeated. As a bonus, Strahd believes that this undead apocalypse will surely drive the Barovians into fear and despair, counteracting the players' efforts to bring hope to the valley.</p>"},{"location":"Spoilers/NPC%27s/Strahd%20von%20Zarovich/#strahds-allies_1","title":"Strahd\u2019s Allies","text":"<p>Strahd commands a vast host of beasts, undead, and other minions, which he can direct in a host of plots or schemes.

While Strahd retains the power of the Forest Fane, he can cast beast sense, locate creature, and animal shapes without components and without expending spell slots. </li> <li>Rejuvenation.
